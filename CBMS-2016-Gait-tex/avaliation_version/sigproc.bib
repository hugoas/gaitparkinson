  Review                   = {------------------------------------------------------ Resumo ------------------------------------------------------ Para mover o tratatamento de sa√∫de do hospital para as tecnologias assistidas em casa √© vital conhecer como as tecnologias podem ser utilizadas. Baseado em pequisa qualitativa esse artigo busca encontrar o engajamento dos envolvidos nas atividades de assist√™ncia m√©dica e suas rotina normal e como essas pessoas conseguem adotar a tecnologia de assist√™ncia m√©dica. Nessa pesquisa foram explorados cinco fatores: objetos, atividades, lugares caracter√≠stica da da e a colabora√ß√£o. Considera√ß√µes ------------- O artigo √© da √°rea de HCI, e busca fazer uma an√°lise qualitativa de como 4 pacientes fazem o tratamento de sua doen√ßa cr√¥nica. O autor faz a distin√ß√£o em uma matriz de 4 tipos de pacientes: Vis√≠veis e invis√≠veis; segmentados e integrados. Para o autor existem os pacientes que fazem o tratamento de forma invis√≠vel ou escondendo a doen√ßa e outros que o estado √© t√£o grave ou n√£o se importam e deixam seu tratamento √† vista de todos. Os pacientes segmentados s√£o aqueles que conseguem conciliar o seu tratamento com outra atividade e o integrado √© aquele que est√° em constante tratamento. O autor reconhece que devido ao estado de sa√∫de √© bem prov√°vel que o mesmo paciente v√° migrando de um ponto a outro. Geralmente os pacientes mais cr√≠ticos s√£o vis√≠veis e integrados, como no caso de Poul, paciente pesquisado que possui 65 anos com diabetes a v√°rios e j√° anda de cadeira de rodas devido as complica√ß√µes. O autor trata nesse artigo do self-care para ele isso significa que a pessoa √© tratada de fora da cl√≠nica m√©dica, para ele isso n√£o √© uma tarefa individual mas sim de todos os envolvidos como familiares por exemplo. Por conta disso h√° uma distribui√ß√£o de responsabilidade entre os provedores de asssist√™ncia m√©dica, pacientes e demais envolvidos no tratamento. M√©todo de pesquisa ------------------ O foco da pesquisa foi as tecnologias assistivas na sa√∫de e seu gerenciamento em casa. Esse artigo n√£o se preocupa com as tecnologias utilizadas mas sim na an√°lise do pr√≥prio usu√°rio. Foram analisados 3 pacientes: - Karen- segundo a classifica√ß√£o do autor ela √© segmentada e invis√≠vel: 63 anos, defeito no cora√ß√£o desde 2001 e elevado risco de ter aneurisma cerebral. Seu esposo faz o acompanhamento baseado em anti-coagulante. √â facilmente gerenciado pois uma vez na semana ela faz exame de INR, ajustando o medicamente de acordo com o resultado. Contudo a paciente possui vaidade e √†s vezes n√£o segue o tratamento √† risca devido a suas atividades. Eventualmente seu esposo a lembra de tomar a medica√ß√£o. Ela consegue deixa o tratamento invis√≠vel aos demais, poupando inclusive outros familiares a respeito de noticias. - Maja- devido ao seu trabalho ela gerencia a doen√ßa de forma invis√≠vel e integrada a suas atividades e rotinas di√°rias. Maja √© conhecida do autor desde um projeto que ela participou de gerenciamento de diabetes durante a gravidez. Maja possui 30 anos, √© professora e possui diagnostica a diabetes tipo I a alguns anos. √â casada com Thomas. Maja precisa tomar insulina antes de dormir para regular os n√≠veis de glicose. Com a gravidez ela nunca tinha passado por um n√≠vel de glicose t√£o baixo. Maja eventualmente esquece do tratamento e fica com os n√≠ves bastante desregulados. Preocupando Thomas que sabe o quanto prejudica a crian√ßa que vai nascer. Poul- 65 anos, estado avan√ßado de diabetes. Participa de um projeto de monitoria da press√£o do sangue e ingest√£o de medicamentos. Ele mora no primeiro andar mas n√£o pode pegar elevador, logo sai de casa uma vez na semana, justamente por conta do tratamento. Esse paciente est√° num est√°gio que n√£o tem como ficar invis√≠vel e devido a suas complica√ß√µes n√£o tem como n√£o ser integrado. Poul n√£o possui conv√≠vio social e seus familiares moram em outro pa√≠s, eventualmente conversa com os filhos ao telefone. Poul recebe diversos profissionais em sua resid√™ncia. Bastante atento com o gerenciamento da diabetes a mant√©m os registros meticulosamente. Possuindo integrado o tratamento da diabetes a outras atividades. A sua rotina est√° toda envolta da doen√ßa. =============================== Fatores de pesquisa explorados: =============================== Objetos ------- As ferramentas, sensores, glucograma e demais objetos de tratamento de sa√∫de s√£o bastante estigmatizados, e conseq√ºentemente existe toda uma cultura que por quest√£o de vaidade, sociedade ou outro motivo venham a atrapalhar seu uso e conseq√ºenemente impactar no tratamento. Os pacientes informaram que o quanto as tecnologias pudessem se tornar invis√≠veis seria melhor. Para eles isso os daria muita qualidade de vida e o sentimento que sentiriam √© q estavam com uma vida normal, melhorando assim sua auto-estima e conseq√ºentemente o tratamento seria mais eficaz. Atividades ---------- Similaremente aos objetos as atividades relatadas durante o tratamento s√£o afetadas por quest√µes culturais, de acordo com a atividade desempenhada, instante de tratamento e o escopo da pr√≥pria atividade. Algumas atividades relatadas no tratamento da doen√ßa por vezes demandam mais esfor√ßo do que outros, afetando em determinados momentos a pr√≥pria atividade. A an√°lise de glicose no sangue por exemplo, durante a gravidez MAJA tem que reavaliar o n√≠vel e ajustar com insulina a cada uma hora e meia. Contudo nesse interst√≠cio ela esta em sala de aula e ela n√£o quer interromper para fazer a medi√ß√£o. Maja escolheu segmentar seu tratamento nessa situa√ß√£o quando ela geralmente busca a integra√ß√£o. Karen faz a medi√ß√£o uma vez por semana, o que permite que ela tenha total integra√ß√£o com suas atividades. Localiza√ß√£o ----------- Como descrito anteriormente a resid√™ncia est√° estruturada para ser parte p√∫blica e parte privada. Poul busca arranjar seus objetos Caracter√≠stica da Doen√ßa ------------------------ Quando uma pessoa adoece e faz o atendimento em casa, √© dif√≠cil aceitar a doen√ßa detro de casa. O seriedade da doen√ßa afeta em como a pssoa vai integrar ou segmentar a doen√ßa. Colabora√ß√£o ----------- Todos os tr√™s casos demonstrou que o tratamento da sa√∫de √© uma atividade colaborativa, envolvendo v√°rias pessoas. ----------------- Preceitos dos artigos: 1. Movimento crescente de levar os pacientes de casa ao hospital. 2. Crescimento da ocorr√™ncia de doen√ßas cr√¥nicas e conseq√ºentemente uma necessidade de prestar assist√™ncia em casa. 3. Pontos positivos ----------------- 1. O autor faz uma explora√ß√£o em como as pessoas gerenciam a doen√ßa em casa incluindo como as tecnologias de assist√™ncia m√©dica s√£o empregadas e organizadas no dia a dia. 2. O artigo busca integrar a vida das pessoas nas atividades de assist√™ncia m√©dica e nas atividades que n√£o dizem respeito √† assist√™ncia m√©dica. Trabalhos futuros ----------------- - Desenvolvimento de tecnologias de healthcare em casa para a casa. - Explorar o papel da severidade da doen√ßa e a depend√™ncia das tecnologias para integrar ou segmentar o tratamento.

  Abstract                 = {To move treatment successfully from the hospital to that of technology assisted self-care at home, it is vital in the design of such technologies to understand the setting in which the health {IT} should be used. Based on qualitative studies we find that people engage in elaborate boundary work to maintain the order of the home when managing disease and adopting new healthcare technology. In our analysis we relate this boundary work to two continuums of visibility-invisibility and integration-segmentation in disease management. We explore five factors that affect the boundary work: objects, activities, places, character of disease, and collaboration. Furthermore, the processes are explored of how boundary objects move between social worlds pushing and shaping boundaries. From this we discuss design implications for future healthcare technologies for the home.},

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an organizing framework based on principles of learning theory to classify and rank exergames according to embedded behavior change principles. Behavioral contingencies represent a key theory-based game design principle that can be objectively measured, evaluated, and manipulated to help explain and change the frequency and duration of game play. Case examples are presented that demonstrate how to code dimensions of behavior, consequences of behavior, and antecedents of behavior. Our framework may be used to identify game principles which, in the future, might be used to predict which games are most likely to promote adoption and maintenance of leisure time physical activity.},

Agboola, 25 New Chardon street, Suite 300, Boston, MA 02128, USA. email: sagboola{at}partners.orgAbstract Over the last decade, Connected Health (CH) has shown great value in the management of chronic disease (CD), but has limited application in preventing these diseases that remain a huge burden to the society. Technological advances have made determination of genetic predisposition to disease possible and have gained wide use in oncology to develop more effective and individualized treatment strategies{\textemdash}Personalized Medicine. There is growing interest in the application of these genetic tests in predicting risk for complex genetic diseases; even, direct-to-consumer tests are increasingly becoming available and affordable. CH has shown great potential in collecting phenotypic data, which can be overlaid on genomic data to deliver a more precise and personalized preventive care that better engages patients. The goal of a CH program that uses genetic data would be to monitor individuals{\textquoteright} risk factors and predict the onset of CD. This prediction would be coupled with coaching to delay or prevent the onset of disease. However, the challenge remains that many CDs are due to complex interaction between genes and modifiable environmental risk factors that are still under-studied. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

  Abstract                 = {Proliferation of small handheld devices and wireless technologies has kindled the phenomenon of pervasive computing. Healthcare, being a prime concern for every society, has been considered as an ideal setting for deployment of this technology. Pervasive healthcare aims to improve patient independent living and quality of life and pay special attention to issues of security, privacy, transparency and ease of use. From its very nature of being open and dynamic, the pervasive environment has been challenged with security and privacy related issues with regards to collaborative information sharing. In this paper, we present some of the privacy challenges that arise when designing pervasive healthcare environments and discuss addressing some of these issues in a home based patient monitoring system. Specifically, we cover privacy violation through individual healthcare information availability and information leakage through context-aware services.},

  Review                   = {Towards privacy protection in pervasive healthcare ------------------------------------------------- O termo pervasive health care √© utilizado para descrever a integra√ß√£o entre o uso da computa√ß√£o pervasiva na assist√™ncia m√©dica. A necessidade de sistemas de assist√äncia m√©dica se deve ao fato de: profissionais da sa√∫de precisam de mobilidade al√©m de terem que compartilhar suas experi√™ncia e informa√ß√µes com os demais profissionais respons√°veis por determinado paciente. Nos √∫ltimos anos houve um crescimento no atendimento m√©dico domiciliar. Em todos os casos h√° uma necessidade de acesso ub√≠quo √†s informa√ß√µes do paciente. √â sabido que na rela√ß√£o m√©dico-paciente existe um pacto de confidencialidade. Logo se estamos num ambiente de computa√ß√£o ub√≠qua onde a informa√ß√£o √© trafegada atrav√©s de ambientes sem-fio essa a securidade dessa informa√ß√£o pode ficar comprometida. Os sistemas de assist√™ncia m√©dica, ficam na barreira da confidencialidade da informa√ß√£o e compartilhamento da mesma, visto que os m√©dicos devem compartilhar opni√µes e status do pacientecom outros profissionais da √°rea, para que haja um diagn√≥stico correto. Por esse motivo faz-se necess√°rio o uso de um gerenciador de confidencialidade[31]. Nesse artigo o autor descreve, dois poss√≠veis viola√ß√µes de privacidade: atacar os registros individuais dos pacientes, ou violar todo o contexto da informa√ß√£o atrav√©s de vazamento de informa√ß√£o. A primeira corrobora com o fato de quando e como a informa√ß√£o deve ser preservada, quem s√£o os donos da informa√ß√£o, quem deve implantar os meios de prote√ß√£o da informa√ß√£o. A segunda se deve ao fato de acessar toda a base de dados do sistema. O autor cria 4 poss√≠veis cen√°rios de viola√ß√£o da informa√ß√£o: Cen√°rio 1: Paciente com problema de press√£o alta, prefere estar em cas em detrimento a um hospital. M√©dico concorda que trat√°-lo n√£o √© perigoso desde que haja um n√≠vel de supervis√£o, at√© ele voltar a sua vida normal. A computa√ß√£o pervasiva ira√° permitir que o paciente instale um sistema monitor em sua casa. O sistema ir√° monitor√°-lo diariamente, e armazenar todas suas informa√ß√µes em arquivos de log para ser avaliado pelo m√©dico no futuro. Problemas, O paciente √© dono de suas informa√ß√µes e pode prover acesso para outras pessoas. Ele n√£o deve possuir acesso para modificar as informa√ß√µes. Cen√°rio 2: O sistema pervasivo de informa√ß√µes m√©dicas fica instalado na casa do paciente, e qualquer pessoa pode entrar na casa e pode ter acesso. Logo para resolver os problemas de seguran√ßa √© necess√°rio haver mecanismos de aut√™ntica√ß√£o para permitir ou negar o acesso as informa√ß√µes. Cen√°rio 3: Um m√©dico realiza as medi√ß√µes no pacientes e por motivos de tratamento o m√©dico n√£o deseja que o paciente tenha acesso as pr√≥prias informa√ß√µes. Ent√£o, √© permitido que o m√©dico negue o acesso √† informa√ß√£o? Cen√°rio 4: Uma enfermeira √© apontada para tomar conta do paciente. Ela precisa de acesso a todo hist√≥rico de informa√ß√£o do paciente, contudo n√£o possui acesso de visualiza√ß√£o. E o m√©dico que poderia liberar essa informa√ß√£o n√£o est√° presente. Mesmo que o paciente libere a informa√ß√£o, esta pode ser de propriedade do m√©dico, o qual n√£o concordaria em disponibilizr o acesso. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dificuldades encontradas na Pervasive Healthcare: Viola√ß√£o de Privacidade As viola√ß√µes de privacidade √†s vezes ignoradas nos modelos pervasivos, deve ser tratada com muito cuidado no que se refere a sistemas de assist√™ncia m√©dica. 1- Divulga√ß√£o de informa√ß√µes indesejadas Aqui nos referimos ao direito √† privacidade. Informa√ß√µes m√©dicas s√£o direitos adquiridos inclusive por leis federais, ficando a indaga√ß√£o quando e como a informa√ß√£o deve ser protegida. 2. Preven√ß√£o do vazamento de informa√ß√£o atrav√©s do contexto Os sistemas de healthcare primam pela informa√ß√£o contextual condendo detalhas como localidade, hor√°rio de acontecimento dos eventos. Isso viola alguns dos direitos √† privaciade individual. Divulga√ß√£o de informa√ß√µes indesejadas -------------------------------------- Nos Estados Unidos as leis federais garatem a privacidade das informa√ß√µes no sistema de sa√∫de. Os novos m√©todos de transa√ß√µes eletr√¥nicas permitem a porte√ß√£o a securan√ßa e confidencialidade das informa√ß√µes m√©dicas. Planos de sa√∫de e sistemas p√∫blicos conduzem seus acertos financeiros eletr√¥nicamente.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in healthcare applications is growing in a fast pace. Numerous applications such as heart rate monitor, blood pressure monitor and endoscopic capsule are already in use. To address the growing use of sensor technology in this area, a new field known as wireless body area networks (WBAN or simply BAN) has emerged. As most devices and their applications are wireless in nature, security and privacy concerns are among major areas of concern. Due to direct involvement of humans also increases the sensitivity. Whether the data gathered from patients or individuals are obtained with the consent of the person or without it due to the need by the system, misuse or privacy concerns may restrict people from taking advantage of the full benefits from the system. People may not see these devices safe for daily use. There may also possibility of serious social unrest due to the fear that such devices may be used for monitoring and tracking individuals by government agencies or other private organizations. In this paper we discuss these issues and analyze in detail the problems and their possible measures.},

  Review                   = {Applications of wireless sensor networks focused on monitoring the health status of patients have been in demand and various projects are in the development and implementation stages [4, 6, 9]. Sensor networks in healthcare application scenario are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 2, the growth of WSN is rapid and fast. The projected sales of sensors are going to increase rapidly. Similarly Fig. 3 shows the world revenue forecast and growth rate for healthcare, medical and biometrics markets. We can see that sensor networks have a great future ahead with tremendous growth rate. Sensor networks applications in healthcare have potential for large impacts [18]. These can be realized through real-time, continuous vital monitoring to give immediate alerts of changes in patient status. The data can also be relayed to the hospital or correlate with patient records and so on. Home monitoring applications for chronic and elderly patients which can be used to collect periodic or continuous data and be uploaded to a physician and can allow long-term care and trend analysis. It can also reduce length of hospital stay. Manual tracking of patient status is difficult. Collection of long-term databases of clinical data can be used in future diagnosis. There are concerns of health hazards for the implanted sensor devices. The above concerns have far reaching social implications. The social implications and issues that are directly related to the above mentioned application scenarios can be categorized into three major areas‚Äî 1. security 2. privacy and 3. legal issues. In this paper, we discuss the security and privacy issues of wireless sensor networks application within healthcare perspective. Some of the major indoor/outdoor application projects are mentioned here - HealthGear [12] It is a product of Microsoft Research. It consists of a set of physiological sensors connected via Bluetooth to a cell phone. It is basically a wearable real-time health system for monitoring and analyzing physiological signals. - MobiHealth [24] It is a mobile healthcare project funded by the European Commission. It allows patients to be fully mobile while undergoing continuous health monitoring by utilizing UMTS and GPRS networks. - Ubimon [26] It is from the Department of Computing, Imperial College, London. The aim of this project is to address the issues related to using wearable and implantable sensors for distributed mobile monitoring. Two areas under consideration are the management of patients with arrhythmic heart disease and the follow-up monitoring of post operative care in patients who have had surgery. - CodeBlue [20] It is a research project at Harvard University, US. It integrates sensor nodes and other wireless devices into a disaster response setting. It is designed to work across various network densities and a wide range of wireless devices. From a tiny small sensor mote to more powerful devices such as PDSs, PCs can be combined in CodeBlue. - eWatch [7] It is a wearable sensor and notification platform developed for context aware computing research. It fits into a wrist watch form making it highly available, instantly viewable, and socially acceptable. eWatch provides tactile, audio and visual notification while sensing and recording light, motion, sound and temperature. ----------------- O autor mostra uma tabela comparando medical Ban e general Ban. Um ponto interessante √© que a seguran√ßa deve ser forte exceto para casos de emerg√™ncia. ------------------- IEEE 802.15.6 also known as Task Group 6 (or TG6) was formed in November 2007 to address the issues and standardize WBAN. The call for proposal was issued in January 2009 and heard till May 2009. The standard intends to address both medical/healthcare applications and other non-medical applications with diverse requirements [5]. The MAC layer in the standard intends to define short range, wireless communication in and around the body area. The standard aims to support a low complexity, low cost, ultra-low power and highly reliable wireless communication for use in close proximity to, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans) to satisfy an evolutionary set of entertainment and healthcare products and services. Security issues are major concern raised by most authors. Privacy issue or other social implications are not discussed extensively regarding this field. Security Issues ----------------------- People have different perspective regarding security and hence it is defined in many ways. In general words, security is a concept similar to safety of the system as a whole. The communications in sensor networks applications in healthcare are mostly wireless in nature. This may result in various security threats to these systems. These threats and attacks could pose serious problems to the social life of an individual who is using the wireless sensor devices. Security issues in healthcare applications of sensor networks have been always part of active research. Security issues in general wireless sensor networks are a major area of research in recent times. Some works include [16, 17]. Similarly many people such as [5, 8, 11] have specifically addressed security issues with respect to healthcare applications. The security issues can be divided into two broad levels: system security and information security. Similarly vital data transmission from WBAN networks through GPRS or similar networks can be stolen by eavesdropping. People with bad intent may use the information for harmful activities. The attacks which can occur in any healthcare system using wireless sensor networks are shown in Table 2. a. Data modification - The attacker can delete or replace part or all of eavesdropped information and send the modified information back to original receiver to achieve some illegal purpose. b. Impersonation attack‚ÄîIf an attacker eavesdrops a wireless sensor node‚Äôs identity information, it can be uses to cheat the other nodes. c. Eavesdropping‚ÄîFor the open features of wireless channel used by sensor networks, any opponent can intercept radio communications between the wireless nodes freely and easily. d. Replaying‚ÄîThe attacker can eavesdrop a piece of valid information and resend it to original receiver after a while to achieve same purpose in different case. Authors in [28] argued that in the light of modern concepts of security, the safety should accompany the availability, scalability, efficiency and the quality parameters of inter-node communication. Security threats should include all aspects of the network and its applications. a) System Security i) Administrative Level Security ii) Physical Level Security iii) Technical Level Security b) Information security a. Data Encryption b. Data Integrality c. Authentication d. Freshness Protection Conclusion ----------------- In this paper we tried to raise the concerns of major social implications like privacy and security. General public should also be made aware of the benefits and implications so that they are better prepared. Rules and regulations like that of cyber laws and existing health regulations should be formalized and implemented.},

  Review                   = {The pervasive healthcare systems provide rich contextual information and alerting mechanisms against odd conditions with continuous moni- toring. This minimizes the need for caregivers and helps the chronically ill and elderly to survive an independent life, besides provides quality care for the babies and little children whose both parents have to work. Dados: One of the major challenges of the world for the last decades has been the continuous elderly population increase in the developed countries. Pop- ulation Reference Bureau [2] forecasts that in the next 20 years, the 65-and-over population in the developed countries will be nearly 20% of the overall population. Motiva√ß√£o: One promising application in that area is the integration of sensing and consumer electronics technologies which would allow people to be constantly monitored. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents and their caregivers by providing continuous medical monitoring, memory enhancement, control of home appliances, medical data access, and emergency communication. Researchers in computer, networking, and medical fields are working together in order to make the broad vision of smart healthcare possible. The importance of integrating large-scale wireless telecommunication technologies such as 3G, Wi-Fi Mesh, and WiMAX, with telemedicine has already been addressed by some researchers. Outras Tecnologias: Further improvements will be achieved by the coexistence of small-scale personal area technologies like radio frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and wireless sensor networks, together with large-scale wireless networks to provide context-aware applications Monitoramento Cont√≠nuo Permitir√°: Given the importance of the subject, there are already several applications and prototypes on the subject. For example, some of them are devoted to continuous monitoring for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs or similar cognitive diseases. Some focus on fall detection, posture detection and location tracking and others make use of biological and environmental sensors to identify patients‚Äô health status. Benef√≠cios e Considera√ß√µes de Design para Sistemas de Monitoramento para Healthcare In healthcare applications, a real-time system is actually a soft real-time system, in which some latency is allowed [13]. Identifying emergency situations like heart attacks or sudden falls in a few seconds or even minutes will suffice for saving lives considering that, without them these conditions will not be identified at all. Together with the mature and also inexpensive RFID technology, the costs for pervasive healthcare systems are within the affordable range for many people. In Caregiver‚Äôs Assistant [14], inexpensive RFID tags are placedon household object and the systems precision can be in- creased at very low costs, by tagging more objects with these RFID tags. Most of the existing solutions include one or more types of sensors carried by the patient, forming a Body Area Network (BAN), and one or more types of sensors deployed in the environment forming a Personal Area Network (PAN). The emergency situations produce alerts by the application and these alerts and other health status information can be reached via mo- bile devices like laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and smart phones. The overview of a simple wireless sensor network application scenario is depicted in Fig. 1. Poss√≠veis Usu√°rios: Children: this group consists of young people who are not capable of taking care of themselves like babies, Elderly and chronically ill: this group includes the chronically ill people who have cognitive difficulties or other medical disorders related with heart, respiration, etc. Caregivers: this group is comprised of the parents and the baby-sitters of the children group and also the caregivers and other care network of the elderly and the chronically ill. Healthcare professionals: these are the professional caregivers like physicians and other medical staff who are responsible from the constant health status monitoring of the elderly and the chronically ill people and are capable of giving the immediate response in case of an emergency situation. COLOCAR A TABELA 1. Considera√ß√µes de Design Body Area Network Subsystem The Body Area Network Subsystem is the ad hoc sensor network and tags that the children and the elderly carry on their body. The RFID tags, ElectroCardioGram (ECG) sensors, and accelerometers worn by the patient, are example components of the body area network. LER ----- Zhou et al. propose a three layer network structure for a pervasive medical supervision system based on wireless sensor networks [86]. The first layer is the medical sensor layer providing information such as the oximetry, the heart rate/pulse and the blood pressure. The medical sensors form a star schema network with a gateway node elected by either a self-organizing protocol or manual configura- tion. The second layer provides reliable transmission. If the patient is at home, the physiological data is transferred to one of the nearest wireless nodes that are emplaced in the house. These nodes not only relay the data to the PC with an Internet connection in a multi-hop manner but also provide contextual data such as temperature, and the patient‚Äôs video/picture in emergency situations. When the patient is outside, the relay mission is accomplished by a mobile phone or a PDA device. The third layer of the system is responsible for the aggregation of physiological data in a remote medical center for analysis and providing feed-back data back to the patient through a mobile phone, a PDA or web services. Another example is the Baby Glove [87] which consists of two integrated sensor plates placed on infant‚Äôs upper torso, which contain a temperature sensor and electrodes that monitor the infant‚Äôs pulse rate and hydration. The device is comprised of two motes. One is connected to the infant‚Äôs clothing and the other to a base station computer. The first mote collects the vital sign information coming from the sensors and transmits them wirelessly to the second mote which is connected to the base station computer for processing. If the vital signs are over the limits, the caregivers are alerted. LISTENse is a prototype that enables the hearing impaired to perceive the critical sound information like doorbell or smoke alarm. It is comprised of at least two wireless sensor network motes. There are also some studies for identification of complications of some diseases such as epilepsy seizure. AWARENESS [90] is an example context-aware health application that is designed to detect and react to epilepsy seizures. In a neurological body area network prototype, the ECG data captures an epilepsy seizure; however, without the context information the change in the heart rate cannot be reliably attributed to an epilepsy seizure since it may be due to motion.

  Review                   = {Este estudo teve como objetivo analisar os efeitos do biofeedback na estimula√ß√£o da movimenta√ß√£o de ombro em idosa com parkinsonismo. Foi aplicado por um per√≠odo de quatro (04) sess√µes, associado aos exerc√≠cios tradicionais de Terapia Ocupacional, o m√©todo de biofeedback por meio do aparelho Biofeed¬Æ. Em consequ√™ncia dos sinais e sintomas cl√≠nicos citados anteriormente, com especial aten√ß√£o a bradicinesia, verifica-se que uma reduzida velocidade dos movimentos volunt√°rios assim como reduzida amplitude de movimento do membro solicitado para realizar o movimento. Assim, os parkinsonianos necessitam de esfor√ßo mental e maior gasto de energia para realizar suas atividades. A bradicinesia √© o sintoma mais incapacitante da DP, pois com a lentid√£o e a necessidade de maior tempo para realiza√ß√£o das tarefas, os indiv√≠duos acabam se tornando dependentes de cuidadores 2 . A tradicional atua√ß√£o da reabilita√ß√£o f√≠sica com parkinsonistas tem sido focalizada em ensinar aos pacientes estrat√©gias para compensar os sintomas da patologia. O uso de dicas externas e de estrat√©gias cognitivas foi considerado a op√ß√£o principal no tratamento com essa popula√ß√£o. Assim, estes indiv√≠duos s√£o instru√≠dos a processar conscientemente as informa√ß√µes que est√£o envolvidas em um movimento 8 . O biofeedback tem se mostrado um poderoso instrumento para o ajustamento (adapta√ß√£o e readapta√ß√£o) das estrat√©gias motoras de pessoas com algum d√©ficit neurol√≥gico. Antes da aplica√ß√£o do biofeedback foram realizados os seguintes procedimentos: mensura√ß√£o da amplitude articular do ombro (direito e esquerdo) no movimento de abdu√ß√£o, por meio de um goni√¥metro da marca Cescor; avalia√ß√£o da for√ßa muscular de acordo com Kendall e familiariza√ß√£o com o procedimento. A melhora no controle motor pelo sistema de biofeedback pode ser explicada pelo fato que conforme os indiv√≠duos encontram dificuldades em desenvolver estrat√©gias de aten√ß√£o seletiva, √© necess√°rio facilitar a aprendizagem motora direcionando o foco da aten√ß√£o, o uso das dicas de aprendizagem √© uma maneira eficiente de promover a seletividade da aten√ß√£o, pois assim, a aprendizagem motora √© favorecida atrav√©s do refor√ßo simples, espec√≠fico e direcionado aos pontos cr√≠ticos da tarefa a ser aprendida Diante do exposto acima concluiu-se que, o estudo foi de extrema import√¢ncia, onde atrav√©s do instrumento BioFeed¬Æ podemos verificar os benef√≠cios na melhora da amplitude de movimento de membros superiores, bem como, a frequ√™ncia e velocidade de realiza√ß√£o destes movimentos, que obteve grande aux√≠lio na preserva√ß√£o das capacidades funcionais da paciente dentro das limita√ß√µes impostas pela doen√ßa. Outros aspectos positivos foram o fator motivacional e cognitivo. Ao comparar os valores obtidos na primeira sess√£o com a √∫ltima sess√£o para ambos os membros superiores, percebe-se que ocorreu aumento da amplitude de movimento articular, de 120¬∞ para 140¬∞ no ombro direito e de 130¬∞ para 140¬∞ no ombro esquerdo, com a aplica√ß√£o do biofeedback (Tabela 1). DISCUSS√ÉO Os resultados obtidos mostram que apesar do n√∫mero reduzido de sess√µes, ocorreu melhora na amplitude de movimento articular e do controle motor da paciente. Estes resultados n√£o corroboram com estudo realizado com pacientes com Doen√ßa de Parkinson e Alzheimer 10,11 . Os autores encontraram que nos est√°gios iniciais da doen√ßa de Parkinson com a aus√™ncia do feedback visual a programa√ß√£o e performance motora foi semelhante aos do grupo controle. No entanto quando fornecido o feedback visual houve diminui√ß√£o da velocidade e da fase de transporte do movimento dos pacientes com Parkinson quando comparados ao grupo controle. Os autores sugerem que esses resultados podem ter decorrido da necessidade de treino portempo mais prolongado com os pacientes com Parkinson, como do fato que o feedback visual pode induzir os pacientes a mudan√ßas de estrat√©gias agindo de forma a distrair o paciente e prejudicar sua performance motora ao inv√©s de auxili√°-lo.},

Automatic on-body device localization ensures correctness and accuracy of measurements in health and medical monitoring systems. In addition, it provides opportunities to improve the performance and usability of ubiquitous devices. Our technique uses accelerometers to capture motion data to estimate the location of the device on the user‚Äôs body, using mixed supervised and unsupervised time series analysis methods. We have evaluated our technique with extensive experiments on 25 subjects. On average, our technique achieves 89% accuracy in estimating the location of devices on the body. In order to study the feasibility of classification of left limbs from right limbs (e.g., left arm vs. right arm), we performed an analysis, based on which no meaningful classification was observed. Personalized ultraviolet monitoring and wireless transmission power control comprise two immediate applications of our on-body device localization approach. Such applications, along with their corresponding feasibility studies, are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Designing security mechanisms such as privacy and access control for medical sensor networks is a challenging task; as such systems may be operated very frequently, at a quick pace, and at times in emergency situations. Understandably, clinicians hold extra unproductive tasks in low regard, and experience from user workshops and observations of clinicians at work on a hospital ward show that if the security mechanisms are not well designed, the technology is either rejected altogether, or they are circumvented leaving the system wide open to attacks [1]. Our work targets the problem of designing wireless sensors to be both secure and usable by exploring different solutions on a fully functional prototype platform. In this paper, we present an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based protocol, which offers fully secure sensor set-up in a few seconds on standard (Telos) hardware. We evaluate this protocol‚Äôs time and energy consumption, and its impact on the battery lifetime.},

  Review                   = {In this paper, we present an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based protocol, Several experimental sensor network platforms have emerged in recent years targeted at clinical use, but only few consider the importance of security issues such as privacy and access control, which can have a huge impact on usability. Existem v√°rios trabalhos de aplica√ß√£o de redes sensores para monitoramento cl√≠nico, por√©m somente alguns consideram a impert√¢ncia dos problemas de seguran√ßa e prviacidade e controle de acesso, os quais possuem alto impacto de usabilidade. C√°lculos que podem ser realizados em fra√ß√µes de segundo em PCs, podem levar v√°rios segundos ou at√© mesmo minutos se forem realizados nos sensores. Os maiores problemas podem ser a latencia da interface, demora dos c√°lculos, demanda da rede, infraestrutura de rede e servidores indispon√≠veis. Os autores rejeitam qualquer solu√ß√£o de sensores que necessitem interfer√™ncia do departamento de ti do hospital. Os sensores devem estar prontos diretamente da f√°brica. Trabalhos Relacionados ------------------------------------ Projeto CodeBlue: os desenvolvedores n√£o inclu√≠ram nenhum mecanismo de seguran√ßa ou autentica√ß√£o na sua proposta. Several public key cryptography (PKC) implementations for sensor networks have appeared in recent years. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) currently seems the most promising method. One of the most optimised implementation for TinyOS is TinyECC [8], which can perform the basic ECC point multiplication in less than 2 seconds on the MSP430x1 micro-controller (MCU) family found on the Tmote Sky sensor nodes. Conceitos Fundamentais --------------------------------------- Sensor nodes are organised in groups around patients in a 1- to-1 relationship. In order to establish the various (symmetric) keys necessary for wireless communication in the medical sensor network, a few PKC based configuration change protocols are used whenever a (clinical) user configures the network: ‚Ä¢ Add a new sensor to a patient. ‚Ä¢ Remove a sensor from a patient. ‚Ä¢ Change patient property (e.g. move to another hospital). Como mencionado anteriormente os sensores n√£o podem ser reprogramados usando qualquer tecla. Antes disso, o sensor deve saber em quem confiar e comunicar ap√≥s ser ligado [10]. Descri√ß√£o do Protocolo ------------------------------------ For the protocol, we use elliptic curve domain parameters over Fp (p, a, b, G, n, h) given by secp160r1 [12]. We also use a cryptographic hash function, H, described later. All nodes on a patient share a public group-id and a private group-key used for internal group communication, such as property change dissemination. This key is created by the first member of the group in the bootstrap protocol described below, and is never changed. Of course this implies, that there are no forward secrecy for this internal group communication; however, data exchanged internally between nodes constitutes the group history, and will be summarised for new nodes anyway, so this should not be a problem. In the following A, N and S denotes honest players, while A , N and S denotes arbitrary players, who may be dishonest (controlled by an attacking adversary). Due to our data-origin-authenticity assumption about the short-range link, the initial exchange of IDs, and the Diffie-Hellman symmetric key generation, an adversary must know the private key or choose the ID of each node, he is impersonating, to succeed. Notas de Implementa√ß√£o --------------------------------------- Our ECC implementation is shaped after the TinyECC [8] code and uses its large integer computation module (NNM.nc) unchanged. However, as communication and user interaction is needed in parallel with ECC calculations, we re-implemented the point calculations: an ECC calculation will be handed over to a task, performing one computation-step and re-posting itself until the computation is done. Avalia√ß√£o -------------- We evaluated the time and energy consumption on the protocol as well as the different building blocks of the protocol using the ‚ÄúEnergy Bucket‚Äù [15]. For comparison, a Panasonic CR1025 coin cell battery (1 cm in diameter) contains 324 J, while a tiny LR621 watch battery contains only 81 J, so 0.1 J can be quite a lot, if the procedure must be repeated often during the sensor‚Äôs lifetime. However, it would be fair to assume, that patients at hospitals‚Äîand at emergencies as well‚Äîwould carry at least one big sensor or some kind of patient ID Under this assumption, the protocol requires less than 1% of the energy of a watch battery, which should be an acceptable price.

  Abstract                 = {{SPEM is a metamodel adopted by the OMG for software processes engineering. For the software process architectures description, SPEM architectural concepts are very insufficient. Indeed, the existing concepts disallow describing configurations and explicit links specific to software process architectures and finally their deployment. The objective of this paper is to present an extension of SPEM (System and Software Process Engineering Metamodel) with lacking architectural concepts. This extension is an important step to implement a new approach for software process reusing based on software architectures.}},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: The aging of the population creates pressure on the healthcare systems in various ways. A massive increase of chronic disease conditions and age-related illness are predicted as the dominant forces driving the future health care. The objective of this paper is to present future research demands in pervasive healthcare with the goal to meet the healthcare challenges by paving the way for a pervasive, user-centered and preventive healthcare model. Methods: This paper presents recent methodological approaches and proposes future research topics in three areas: i) pervasive, continuous and reliable long-term monitoring systems; ii) prevention through pervasive technology as a key element to maintain lifelong wellness; and iii) design and evaluation methods for ubiquitous, patient-centric technologies. Results: Pervasive technology has been identified as a strong asset for achieving the vision of user-centered preventive healthcare. In order to make this vision a reality, new strategies for design, development and evaluation of technology have to find a common denominator and consequently interoperate. Moreover, the potential of pervasive healthcare technologies offers new opportunities beyond traditional disease treatment and may play a major role in prevention, e.g. motivate healthy behavior and disease prevention throughout all stages of life. In this sense, open challenges in future research have to be addressed such as the variability of health indicators between individuals and the manner in which relevant health indicators are provided to the users in order to maximize their motivation to mitigate or prevent unhealthy behaviors. Additionally, collecting evidence that pervasive technology improves health is seen as one of the toughest challenges. Promising approaches are recently introduced, such as "clinical proof-of-concept" and balanced observational studies. Conclusions: The paper concludes that pervasive healthcare will enable a paradigm shift from the established centralized healthcare model to a pervasive, user-centered and preventive overall lifestyle health management. In order to provide these new opportunities everywhere, anytime and to anyone, future research in the fields of pervasive sensing, pervasive prevention and evaluation of pervasive technology is inevitably needed.},

In this survey, we examine the privacy requirements of \emph{mobile\/} computing technologies that have the potential to transform healthcare. Such \emph{mHealth\/} technology enables physicians to remotely monitor patients' health, and enables individuals to manage their own health more easily. Despite these advantages, privacy is essential for any personal monitoring technology. Through an extensive survey of the literature, we develop a conceptual privacy framework for mHealth, itemize the privacy properties needed in mHealth systems, and discuss the technologies that could support privacy-sensitive mHealth systems.

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} About 50\% of the patients with advanced Parkinson's disease ({PD)} suffer from freezing of gait ({FOG)}, which is a sudden and transient inability to walk. It often causes falls, interferes with daily activities and significantly impairs quality of life. Because gait deficits in {PD} patients are often resistant to pharmacologic treatment, effective non-pharmacologic treatments are of special interest. Objectives: The goal of our study is to evaluate the concept of a wearable device that can obtain real-time gait data, processes them and provides assistance based on pre-determined specifications. {METHODS} We developed a real-time wearable {FOG} detection system that automatically provides a cueing sound when {FOG} is detected and which stays until the subject resumes walking. We evaluated our wearable assistive technology in a study with 10 {PD} patients. Over eight hours of data was recorded and a questionnaire was filled out by each patient. {RESULTS} Two hundred and thirty-seven {FOG} events have been identified by professional physiotherapists in a post-hoc video analysis. The device detected the {FOG} events online with a sensitivity of 73.1\% and a specificity of 81.6\% on a 0.5 sec frame-based evaluation. {CONCLUSIONS} With this study we show that online assistive feedback for {PD} patients is possible. We present and discuss the patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives on wearability and performance of the wearable assistant as well as their gait performance when using the assistant and point out the next research steps. Our results demonstrate the benefit of such a context-aware system and motivate further studies.},

O autor particou de diversos workshops e j√° no in√≠cio do artigo ele fala que os workshops foram evoluindo para : I. M√©dicos e enfermeira debatiam em como a tecnologia m√≥vel e os sensores poderiam ser efetivos para a medicina remota, evitando as hospitaliza√ß√µes. II. Como as tecnologias poderiam auxiliar na administra√ß√£o de medicamento para idosos, incluindo um balanceamento da dieta e monitoramento das condi√ß√µes f√≠sicas. III. Como os idosos e seus familiares poderiam ter uma vida normal, sem deixar de se preocupar com a sa√∫de. Claramente o autor identifica os pontos de tens√µes entre os workshops, para ele os profissionais da sa√∫de e os idosos. Para eles os profissionais acham q os idosos querem evitar doen√ßas a todo custo. Enquanto que os idosos querem gozar da sa√∫de que possuem entre seus 65 e 70 anos. Artigo muito bom, demonstrando uma etnografia de 9 meses. Esse artigo foi baseado em 3 workshops com o design centrado no usu√°rio. O foco da pesquisa √© como desenvolver tecnologia de assistencia m√©dica adequado a rotina di√°ria dos usu√°rios, buscando propor uma ferramenta para idosos independente e adequada a rotina atrav√©s da ubiquidade. 1o Workshop: foi realizado com m√©dicos e enfermeiras que discutiram a respeito como a tecnologia m√≥vel e os sensores poderiam habilitar a telemedicina 2o Workshop: homecare works, como a tecnologia poderia administrar os medicamentos 3o workshop: como os idosos e seus familiares podem ser auxiliados para ter uma vida normal atrav√©s do uso da tecnologia Esses tr√äs workshops foram √∫teis para identificar a tens√£o existente entre os profissionais de sa√∫de e idosos. ------------------------------- Tecnologias de Monitoramento de Pacientes ============================ As tecnologias de monitoramente t√™m sido oferecidas como uma solu√ß√£o para a remo√ß√£o do paciente do hospital para a sua resid√™ncia atrav√©s de servi√ßos de home-care. Bastante utilizada para o monitoramente de pacientes cr√¥nicos e idosos, ainda sofrem rejei√ß√£o a respeito do design da solu√ß√£o. Os sistemas de monitoramento eletr√¥nico tornam poss√≠vel que um filho seja monitorados por seus pais. Ou que um filho possa monitorar a alimenta√ß√£o e as horas de sono de um idoso. Os sistemas de monitoramento tradicionais est√£o sendo desenvolvidos para pacientes que s√£o vistos como "incapazes" de enteder os dados produzidos. Pelo estudo do autor, tanto os: idosos, diab√©ticos e gr√°vidas; Possuem profundo interesse no resultado do que est√° sendo monitorado. O autor encontrou um grande potencial no desenvolvimento de uma tecnologia de monitoramento que n√£o tenha apenas utilidade cl√≠nica, mas seja focado no poss√≠vel uso de seus usu√°rios, melhorando a qualidade de vida do paciente monitorado.},

  Review                   = {A abordagem dessa solu√ß√£o √© desenvolver uma tecnologia de healthcare que permita que os cidad√£os tenham sua rotina e vida normal e ainda conseguir gerenciar e tratar sua doen√ßa cr√¥nica. Esse argumento foi constru√≠do atrav√©s de design centrado no usu√°rio, onde forma avaliados pacientes com diabetes e mulheres gr√°vidas. O autor particou de diversos workshops e j√° no in√≠cio do artigo ele fala que os workshops foram evoluindo para : I. M√©dicos e enfermeira debatiam em como a tecnologia m√≥vel e os sensores poderiam ser efetivos para a medicina remota, evitando as hospitaliza√ß√µes. II. Como as tecnologias poderiam auxiliar na administra√ß√£o de medicamento para idosos, incluindo um balanceamento da dieta e monitoramento das condi√ß√µes f√≠sicas. III. Como os idosos e seus familiares poderiam ter uma vida normal, sem deixar de se preocupar com a sa√∫de. Claramente o autor identifica os pontos de tens√µes entre os workshops, para ele os profissionais da sa√∫de e os idosos. Para eles os profissionais acham q os idosos querem evitar doen√ßas a todo custo. Enquanto que os idosos querem gozar da sa√∫de que possuem entre seus 65 e 70 anos. Artigo muito bom, demonstrando uma etnografia de 9 meses. Esse artigo foi baseado em 3 workshops com o design centrado no usu√°rio. O foco da pesquisa √© como desenvolver tecnologia de assistencia m√©dica adequado a rotina di√°ria dos usu√°rios, buscando propor uma ferramenta para idosos independente e adequada a rotina atrav√©s da ubiquidade. 1o Workshop: foi realizado com m√©dicos e enfermeiras que discutiram a respeito como a tecnologia m√≥vel e os sensores poderiam habilitar a telemedicina 2o Workshop: homecare works, como a tecnologia poderia administrar os medicamentos 3o workshop: como os idosos e seus familiares podem ser auxiliados para ter uma vida normal atrav√©s do uso da tecnologia Esses tr√äs workshops foram √∫teis para identificar a tens√£o existente entre os profissionais de sa√∫de e idosos. ------------------------------- Tecnologias de Monitoramento de Pacientes ============================ As tecnologias de monitoramente t√™m sido oferecidas como uma solu√ß√£o para a remo√ß√£o do paciente do hospital para a sua resid√™ncia atrav√©s de servi√ßos de home-care. Bastante utilizada para o monitoramente de pacientes cr√¥nicos e idosos, ainda sofrem rejei√ß√£o a respeito do design da solu√ß√£o. Os sistemas de monitoramento eletr√¥nico tornam poss√≠vel que um filho seja monitorados por seus pais. Ou que um filho possa monitorar a alimenta√ß√£o e as horas de sono de um idoso. Os sistemas de monitoramento tradicionais est√£o sendo desenvolvidos para pacientes que s√£o vistos como "incapazes" de enteder os dados produzidos. Pelo estudo do autor, tanto os: idosos, diab√©ticos e gr√°vidas; Possuem profundo interesse no resultado do que est√° sendo monitorado. O autor encontrou um grande potencial no desenvolvimento de uma tecnologia de monitoramento que n√£o tenha apenas utilidade cl√≠nica, mas seja focado no poss√≠vel uso de seus usu√°rios, melhorando a qualidade de vida do paciente monitorado.},

  Abstract                 = {As Redes de Sensores do Corpo Humano (RSCH) devem ser projetadas para operar de maneira aut√¥noma. Por outro lado, devem oferecer mecanismos que remetam o controle aos profissionais da sa√∫de. Um grande desafio no projeto de RSCH √© oferecer de forma adequada (com transpar√™ncia) acesso √†s configura√ß√µes internas da rede e dos sensores, sem excluir a capacidade de opera√ß√£o aut√¥noma desses sistemas. A tarefa de configura√ß√£o de RSCH √© usualmente realizada por desenvolvedores especializados, profissionais da Computa√ß√£o. Entretanto, para que essa tecnologia se torne clinicamente vi√°vel, √© necess√°rio que os pr√≥prios profissionais da √°rea de sa√∫de possam faz√™-la. Esses profissionais s√£o os respons√°veis legais pelas decis√µes acerca do monitoramento dos pacientes, mesmo que essas decis√µes tenham sido geradas pelo pr√≥prio sistema. Esta tese discute os pressupostos supracitados e prop√µe um modelo capaz de acomodar essas necessidades. Dois conceitos relacionados √† programa√ß√£o de RSCH s√£o tratados neste trabalho: (i) programa√ß√£o (em tempo de compila√ß√£o) e (ii) configura√ß√£o (em tempo de execu√ß√£o). A programa√ß√£o refere-se √† defini√ß√£o dos artefatos de software e algoritmos que s√£o embutidos dentro dos sensores. Em RSCH a inclus√£o dessa funcionalidade requer uma interface para programa√ß√£o adequada aos profissionais da sa√∫de e tamb√©m de compiladores inteligentes. O compilador inteligente √© um conceito novo apresentado nesta tese. Tem como objetivo aumentar a efici√™ncia no uso dos sensores, considerando os requisitos da aplica√ß√£o, os recursos do hardware e, principalmente, o conhecimento especialista para formula√ß√£o das pol√≠ticas que organizam o funcionamento do sistema. Como exemplo, a inclus√£o de mecanismos e pol√≠ticas para tratar da economia de energia podem ser ajustadas por essas estruturas. A configura√ß√£o refere-se √† capacidade de ajuste do sistema sem a necessidade de reiniciar o hardware. Esse conceito possibilita maior interatividade entre o profissional da sa√∫de e o sistema. Como requisito, os sensores precisam de mecanismos que possibilitem maior controle acerca das tarefas executadas. Uma poss√≠vel solu√ß√£o √© a utiliza√ß√£o de estruturas de dados que possibilitem a aplica√ß√£o do conceito de multitarefa nos sensores. Como contribui√ß√£o maior √© apresentada uma arquitetura de software denominada SOAB (Software Architecture for Body-worn Sensor Networks Project). A arquitetura SOAB √© constitu√≠da por quatro camadas independentes: (i) uma interface para programa√ß√£o; (ii) um middleware para interconex√£o da RSCH com a Internet; (iii) um servidor para execu√ß√£o dos servi√ßos solicitados pelos usu√°rios e (iv) um sistema operacional com suporte para multitarefa, que ser√° embutido nos n√≥s sensores. Esse sistema operacional foi chamado MedOS. Tem como uma de suas funcionalidades aumentar o tempo de funcionamento dos n√≥s sensores, promovendo a redu√ß√£o do consumo de energia el√©trica por meio do escalonamento de tarefas com base em pol√≠ticas adaptadas para aplica√ß√µes biom√©dicas.},

  Review                   = {Esse trabalho corrobora com \cite{and09} quando fala que para as redes sensores serem vi√°veis clinicamente √© necess√°rio que os profissionais de sa√∫de possam configur√°-las. Redes Sensores -------------------------- As Redes de Sensores Sem Fios (RSSF), em ingl√™s Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), exigem t√©cnicas para tratamento de falhas e que promovam adapta√ß√£o a condi√ß√µes ambientais diversas para que o tempo de funcionamento (sobrevida) desses sistemas seja o mais longo poss√≠vel. Por exemplo, em muitos cen√°rios a substitui√ß√£o ou a recarga das baterias √© invi√°vel, em termos de tempo (pode haver centenas de sensores) e acesso f√≠sico (sensores podem estar implantados no corpo humano). Al√©m disso, √© desej√°vel que uma RSSF possa crescer em escala de forma incremental, isto √©, pela adi√ß√£o de novos n√≥s sensores e/ou novas funcionalidades (extensibility), ou pelo aumento do volume da informa√ß√£o manipulada (scalability). Assim, um poss√≠vel aumento da concorr√™ncia por recursos do sistema n√£o pode levar a perda da efic√°cia. De acordo com Lymberis (LYMBERIS & DITTMAR, 2007), a utiliza√ß√£o desses sistemas possibilitar√° a redu√ß√£o de custos hospitalares, pela redu√ß√£o de interna√ß√µes e procedimentos ambulatoriais desnecess√°rios. Tamb√©m, a redu√ß√£o do erro m√©dico porque a intera√ß√£o entre o paciente e o profissional da sa√∫de estar√° dispon√≠vel a qualquer hora e em qualquer lugar que se encontrem. ----------------ATEN√á√ÉO COMO ESCREVER COMPUTA√á√ÉO VESTIDA -------------------------------------------------- No futuro, essa tecnologia poder√° ser embutida na indument√°ria por meio de sistemas vest√≠veis (em ingl√™s, wearable systems) e, at√© mesmo, distribu√≠da dentro do pr√≥prio corpo sob forma de microrob√¥s e nanosensores. ========================================================== Por outro lado, √© indispens√°vel que as RSCH possam tratar falhas, tomar decis√µes e, at√© mesmo, atuar sobre o controle de uma aplica√ß√£o, independentemente de comandos do usu√°rio. Atualmente, o software utilizado em RSCH pode ser classificado de duas formas: 1. Por sistemas propriet√°rios constru√≠dos em fun√ß√£o do hardware e de uma √∫nica aplica√ß√£o. 2. Baseado num modelo de programa√ß√£o gen√©rico e de prop√≥sito geral (Tiny OS). Entretanto, aplica√ß√µes desenvolvidas com base no TinyOS apresentam as seguintes limita√ß√µes para emprego em RSCH: 1. A linguagem de programa√ß√£o NesC imp√µe sintaxe peculiar, baseada em conceitos emergentes da engenharia de software. 2. O modelo de multiprograma√ß√£o oferecido pelo TinyOS √© pouco interativo. Oferece muito pouco controle sobre as poss√≠veis funcionalidades (tarefas) executadas pelos n√≥s sensores, porque n√£o h√° troca de contexto (Bardram cita que √© preciso haver troca de contexto Activity Design). Assim, um grande desafio se apresenta aos projetistas de RSCH. Aumentar com transpar√™ncia o acesso √†s configura√ß√µes internas dos n√≥s sensores e da rede, sem excluir a possibilidade de opera√ß√£o aut√¥noma desses sistemas. Transpar√™ncia refere-se a uma propriedade de sistema. Um sistema √© mais transparente quando ao programador e/ou ao usu√°rio s√£o escondidos detalhes de implementa√ß√£o e do funcionamento desse sistema. --------------- A Transparencia √© primordia para aceita√ß√£o da RSCH. Detalhe em como o autor definiu o conceito de transparencia --------------- Objetivo do Trabalho ============= O objetivo principal deste trabalho √© propor uma arquitetura de RSCH. Essa arquitetura comporta sistemas implementados por software e hardware. Esses sistemas oferecem suporte a um modelo de programa√ß√£o e configura√ß√£o de RSCH, que √© a principal inova√ß√£o deste trabalho. A arquitetura de RSCH proposta neste trabalho foi validada pela implementa√ß√£o de prot√≥tipos (hardware e software) para provas de conceito. Cen√°rios de Uso -------------------------- Num exemplo de aplica√ß√£o desse sistema, se o m√≥dulo de monitora√ß√£o cont√≠nua do ECG (eletrocardiograma) detectar a presen√ßa de uma arritmia card√≠aca associada √† queda da press√£o arterial e o m√≥dulo de monitora√ß√£o de sintomas capturar que o paciente est√° apresentando tontura e turva√ß√£o visual (por exemplo, por meio de comandos de voz emitidos pelo pr√≥prio paciente), o sistema pode integrar essas informa√ß√µes e chegar √† conclus√£o que o indiv√≠duo est√° apresentando uma arritmia grave e que o estado do mesmo √© grave TRabalho Proposto ----------------------------- A SOAB √© constitu√≠da por quatro camadas: (i) aplica√ß√£o, (ii) interconex√£o, (iii) servi√ßos da RSCH e (iv) servi√ßos do hardware. Neste trabalho foram considerados inicialmente dois perfis de usu√°rio: o paciente e o profissional da sa√∫de. Entretanto, o paciente √© um agente passivo no que se refere √† programa√ß√£o e a configura√ß√£o dos sistemas de monitoramento, isto √©, a ele n√£o √© atribu√≠da nenhuma a√ß√£o referente a essa atividade. Os m√©dicos e demais profissionais da sa√∫de representam o segundo perfil de usu√°rio do sistema. Recebem e manipulam as informa√ß√µes obtidas pelo monitoramento e, principalmente, s√£o os respons√°veis por definir e modificar par√¢metros referentes ao monitoramento de seus pacientes. --------------- Inova√ß√£o do Trabalho --------------- O aspecto original deste trabalho envolve uma proposta de mudan√ßa do paradigma utilizado atualmente para programa√ß√£o e configura√ß√£o das redes de sensores. Prop√µe que os pr√≥prios usu√°rios dessa tecnologia possam definir as funcionalidades necess√°rias a cada momento e, ainda, intervir no sistema quando julgar pertinente. Isto, sem excluir a possibilidade desses sistemas se tornarem cada vez mais aut√¥nomos e eficientes. Assim, um modelo de programa√ß√£o e configura√ß√£o de RSCH foi proposto. Esse modelo √© suportado por um conjunto de abstra√ß√µes agrupado em quatro n√≠veis hier√°rquicos e organizados sob forma de uma arquitetura de software de sistema.},

As a result, the incidence of chronic disease is projected to increase, there are predicted shortages in health care workforce and budget restraints; implications for future health care provision are serious. The current model of health care is not equipped to deal with these changes. Connected health care, via the use of health informatics, disease management and home telehealth technologies, has been suggested as an approach to ease the projected strain on future health care. Evidence to date suggests a positive impact of the use of connected health care model; however, the majority of studies have overlooked the involvement of the community pharmacist. As the most common point of contact with primary health services for most of the population, the community pharmacist may be well placed to provide connected health care. The research to date is promising with improvements in outcomes for cardiovascular patients noted; however, further work is required to investigate the potential role the community pharmacist can play in the future of connected health care.},

SERIOUS GAMES REVIEW Apart from being a recreational activity, playing Serious Games also stimulates the development of basic learning skills [5], such as paying attention, visual-motor coordination, logical spatial reasoning, visual perception, spatial structuring, spatial orientation and creativity, among others. The use of entertainment as an adjunct to medical care is not a new idea. Serious games in the healthcare area can be classified as follows, depending on what health disorders are being addressed: obesity, speech problems, rehabilitation, neurological disabilities, psychomotor coordination, etc.: Serious Games for health prevention and education. Depending on the people to whom the games are oriented, they work on aspects such as: diet, sports, hygiene, social abilities... CAREN [6-7].

Although video games are traditionally associated with software developments, developing them in the social and health-care field involves studying the associated hardware and paying attention to aspects related to interaction with the game. Serious Games for Health cover matters related to education and the treatment of illnesses, awareness enhancement and psychological treatment, as well as training doctors in surgical techniques, for example. This chapter includes a review of relevant Serious Game developments over the last ten years and examines new trends.},

Moreover, changes in technology and the large number of formats available make video games a tool that can be oriented towards the treatment and education of different sectors of the population, including: - Crian√ßas - Desabilitados - Idosos The serious games application is intended to help professionals, as well as enabling users to enjoy themselves through straightforward, real interaction while learning how to cope in several real social situations. Developers of serious games for health must meet: ‚Ä¢ Medical Objectives: to treat and inform about diagnosis or to rehabilitate people from different groups with or without functional diversity, with the aid of a user-friendly, simple and attractive tool. ‚Ä¢ Technological Objectives: to design and develop accessible computer applications that implement games with semi-real characters. ‚Ä¢ Social Objectives: to aid education, integration and socialization at home, at school and in urban environments. Technological Objectives: to design and develop accessible computer applications that implement games with semi-real characters. III. SERIOUS GAMES REVIEW Apart from being a recreational activity, playing Serious Games also stimulates the development of basic learning skills [5], such as paying attention, visual-motor coordination, logical spatial reasoning, visual perception, spatial structuring, spatial orientation and creativity, among others. The use of entertainment as an adjunct to medical care is not a new idea. Serious games in the healthcare area can be classified as follows, depending on what health disorders are being addressed: obesity, speech problems, rehabilitation, neurological disabilities, psychomotor coordination, etc.: Serious Games for health prevention and education. Depending on the people to whom the games are oriented, they work on aspects such as: diet, sports, hygiene, social abilities... CAREN [6-7]. Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment is a multi-sensory system for diagnosis, rehabilitation, evaluation and recording. The system works in real time and enables the creation of a range of experiences in a controlled environment that can be repeated using the principles of virtual reality technologies Virtual Environments for rehabilitation [8-10]. This field is one of the most intensely developed. Nowadays, using new technological possibilities is easy and feasible, and new consoles, such as Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect, offer many functionalities. - Serious Gamer for Education Capabilities Pulse!!

We hypothesize that movement disorders in late-stage PD present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from accelerometer (ACC) and surface electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks. Although this paper focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other techniques can be used to analyze large data sets derived from wearable sensors.}},

However, the underlying testing and monitorization processes haven't experienced the innovation and advancement required to fulfill the needs that such diagnosis and treatment present. In this paper we propose a new testing device for Parkinson Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. The device is designed to carry out two of the most used tests for these patients: the finger-tapping test and the hand-grip strength test. The designed system has been divided in three main blocks, which have been implemented and tested: a sensorizec glove, equipped with Force sensitive Resistors (FSR), a tiny hardware device which gathers the data and a PC application, which presents the results to the doctors.

  Review                   = {The current work describes a methodology to automatically detect the severity of bradykinesia in motor disease patients using wireless, wearable accelerometers. This methodology was tested with cross validation through a sample of 20 Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients. This profiler removes the overlap of the segments and calculates the confidence of the resulting events. It also calculates average severity, duration and symmetry values for those events. The profiler has been tested with a bogus dataset. The current work is related to a hardware and software platform that assesses the severity of the bradykinesia symptom in motor disease patients and condenses the information in a way that is easily analyzable and useful to the physician. The dataset used in this study includes trials with twenty Parkinsonian patients, ten in the Navarra and ten in Ioannina, resulting in twenty full cross validations used to train the algorithm and test the method (see TABLE I and TABLE II). . Sensors and materia The data collection was performed with a network of wireless 3-axis accelerometers located on the limbs, trunk and belt of the patient. To classify the epochs, 6 classifiers were used: Knnc K-nearest neighbor classifier, ParzencParzen classifier, ParzendcParzen density based classifier, Treec Construct binary decision tree, Bpxnc Train neural network classifiers by Back-propagation and SVC support vector classifier. All the classification techniques used are characterized by high performances when using huge amount of data. However, as each classifier has different computational charge, all the techniques were tested to find the optimum solution in terms of accuracy and calculation time. The implemented method gives, as output, the severity level of Bradykinesia symptom, according to the UDPRS, where 0 describes the absence of the symptom and 4 describes the highest possible value The criterion followed to distinguish a peak from a short event is given by the clinician recommendations. For the case of bradykinesia, the clinically significant time length is seconds. That means sections in the signal of less than 15 seconds will be tagged as noise. Furthermore, the algorithm returns a list of the events detected, providing start and end times, severity and confidence. Furthermore, the bradykinesia model will provide another parameter widely used in the assessment of the bradykinesia such as the asymmetry, that means the difference of the UPDRS value between the right and left side of the body and the top and bottom limbs. IV. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reports of quantifying bradykinesia severity without requiring standard motor tests. The novel method presented above, using unconstructed, daily life activities, may be causing the symptom severity accuracies within the range of 70%-86%. Future work in this part includes the collection of a larger data sample and the implementation of a meta-analysis to improve accuracy. As for the bradykinesia profiling component of the system, the structure of the method so far is meaningful in that it allows physicians to monitor and detect changes in the symptomatic behavior as quickly as the changes appear. A remotely installed system, at the patient‚Äôs home, with such capabilities could eventually redefine the paradigm of taking care of motor neurodegenerative disease patients, providing far more and richer information to be used by doctors at the time of making decisions or designing treatments.},

  Review                   = {prCita√ß√µes interessantes : Muitos indiv√≠duos ingerem um diferente n√∫mero de medica√ß√µes por dia e sentem dificuldade em gerenciar qual a p√≠lula correta para cada evento (Lundell et al. 2006). One such tool is an electronic caddy that centralizes medications in an automatic dispensing machine with audio prompts for when to take various pills. With a stand-alone system, however, individuals may miss or ignore the caddy prompts and the caddy may not offer assistance if someone deviates from the normal medication routine. --- Instead, a remotely connected medication system could alert caregivers of improper medication use in real time, offering the opportunity to intervene before any serious health damage is done. --- Social connectedness In studies of seniors with dementia who are living at home, one area in which those seniors and caregivers need assistance is in maintaining social connectedness with their friends and relatives. Maintaining quality social health can lead to improvement in overall health and help to maintain a greater quality of life (Haslam et al. 2008). Providing feedback on social health can make seniors and caregivers more proactive in initiating social contact. ------ Data transmission and analysis There are two primary means of applying the above described technologies to home health care: 1) for purposes of event-based transmission and analysis 2) continuous transmission and analysis, which are described below. Event Based: An event-based transmission and analysis system is one that records the occurrence of particular, discrete events, throughout the designated care period. Continuous For some applications, the use of discrete measurements or stationary measuring devices may not be appropriate, or sufficient. Thus, another option for remote home health care technologies lies in the field of continuous transmission and analysis those devices that record information constantly while in use. ----------- Privacy and remote home health care technologies ================================ Therefore, it is important to consider the privacy implications of these technologies, and to design privacy into their development and implementation Se a privacidade for levada em considera√ß√£o durante o processo de desenvolvimento, haver√° um grande potencial que as tecnologias desenvolvidas, tenham a maior possibilidade de gerenciar a privacidade. Information privacy defined ------------------------------------------ Information privacy is an individual‚Äôs ability to exercise control over the collection, use, disclosure and retention of his or her personal information, including personal health information. Personal information (also known as personally identifiable information or ‚ÄúPII‚Äù) is any information, recorded or otherwise, relating to an identifiable individual. When considering information and communication technologies, it is important to recognize that privacy subsumes a set of protections that extend far greater than security. We call this ‚ÄúSmartPrivacy.‚Äù4 Privacy by Design --------------------------- Privacy by Design (PbD) is a concept developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian, in the midnineties. In brief, PbD is a concept that involves embedding privacy into the design specifications of technologies. This process begins by building the principles of Fair Information Practices (FIPs) into the design, operation and management of information processing technologies and systems, and then elaborates them to the gold standard of becoming the default. In total, the three areas of application are: (1) information technology; (2) accountable business practices; and (3) physical design and networked infrastructure. Perhaps the best known code of fair information practices was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), called ‚ÄúGuidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data‚Äù. These guidelines are as follows: 1) Collection Limitation Principle‚ÄîThere should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge and consent of the data subject. 2) Data Quality Principle‚ÄîPersonal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date. 3) Purpose Specification Principle‚ÄîThe purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not later ----------- Aten√ß√£o esse princ√≠pio impacta diretamente 4) Use Limitation Principle‚ÄîPersonal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified inaccordance with principle 3, above, except: a) with the consent of the data subject, or b) by the authority of law. ----------- 5) Security Safeguards Principle‚ÄîPersonal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data. 6) Openness Principle‚ÄîThere should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller. 7) Individual Participation Principle‚ÄîAn individual should have the right: a. To obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation b. To have communicated to him or her, data relating to him or her i. Within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him or her; c. To be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and d. To challenge data relating to him/her and, if the challenge is successful to have the data erased, rectified, completed or amended. 8) Accountability Principle‚ÄîA data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above. ===================== Segundo o autor os princ√≠pios do design baseado em privacidade deve ser aplicado a qualquer sistema de informa√ß√£o pessoal, e com maior rigor para sistemas de informa√ß√µes m√©dicas. O autor lista 7 princi√≠pios principais para sistemas de monitoramento de pacientes: 1. Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedial - It anticipates and prevents privacy-invasive events, before they happen. This proactive approach is fundamental in an environment where the technology is specifically focused on proactively preventing negative health consequences. 2. Privacy as the default - seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice 3. Privacy embedded into design- Privacy must be embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. 4. Functionality‚ÄîPositive-sum, not zero-sum - Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretence of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, or privacy vs. availability, demonstrating that it is possible to have it all. --- GRande IMPACTO E PRINCIPAL PROBLEMA In the health technology industry, this positive-sum paradigm is increasingly critical. No patient should be forced to encounter a trade-off between functionality and information security or privacy. The key for these individuals, and these technologies, is to be patient-outcome focussed; however, there is a moral imperative not to force a trade-off between privacy and good health in order to achieve these objectives. In particular, ensuring that the positive-sum paradigm is followed will involve furthering the Use Limitation principle. Individuals should be empowered with choices about the data pertaining to themselves‚Äîthe purposes for which the data is accessed, and by whom it can be accessed. --- 5. End-to-end lifecycle protection Privacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved, from start to finish. This ensures that at the end of the process, all data are securely destroyed, in a timely fashion. 6. Visibility and transparency Privacy by Design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. A key point to the transparency within these systems is ensuring that the patient in question knows, or at least can know, what data is being collected, how that data is being used, and who can access it. 7. Respect for users‚Äô privacy Above all, Privacy by Design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. ========================= Practical application of Privacy by Design: GE‚Äôs QuietCare and Intel‚Äôs Health Guide O autor falou da aplica√ß√£o GE's Quiet Care The QuietCare system was designed to provide assisted living facilities with notification of change in established behaviour patterns and notifications that a particular event has occurred. ================== Conclus√µes ------------------ Home health care is not reserved for the elderly. This technology may also be applied to any individual with a chronic condition that requires frequent, or constant, care. However, given the demographics of the aging populations in Canada, the United States and all around the world, along with estimates that only 15% of people over 80 do not have a chronic condition (Intel Health 2007), or that 85% of those over 80 do have a chronic condition, it becomes clear that remote home health care technologies are poised to become a vital part of the overall health care provision environment. The economic burden to health care systems in these scenarios is also very high. Using the principles of Privacy by Design, the interests of both patient and caregiver may be met, and the provision of home health care may be delivered in a highly effective, privacy-protective manner. Companies such as Intel and GE Healthcare are proving that a positive-sum paradigm is not only desirable‚Äîit is indeed achievable‚Äîpositive-sum, all the way. In home health care, it may be the only way.},

  Abstract                 = {Exergames are an emerging form of videogames aimed to leverage the advantages of sports and exercise in order to support physical, social and mental health benefits. This study aims at setting out an overview of networked exergame and its usefulness for physical education in cyberspace. A literature review was carried out to investigate the gameplay and the physical demands of some networked exergames. Results emphasize the need for multidisciplinary work between the health sciences, especially physical education, and the field of exergame design. In education, networked exergames have the potential to be incorporated in distance education and e-learning. Also, the combination of flow with instructional strategies can result in high level of student‚Äôs motivation.},

  Review                   = {videogame, active gaming ou exergame (EXG) s√£o termos usados para definir um novo fen√¥meno de videogame, no qual a interface de esfor√ßo permite uma nova experi√™ncia. principalmente nas Ci√™ncias da Sa√∫de [Vaghetti & Botelho, 2010], em √°reas como Medicina, Fisioterapia e, particularmente, a Educa√ß√£o F√≠sica (EF) que, devido √† possibilidade de incorpor√°-los no curr√≠culo, tem atra√≠do a aten√ß√£o dos educadores em escolas e universidades. Sinclair et al. [2007]: a) sua efic√°cia em termos de esfor√ßo f√≠sico, a intensidade do exerc√≠cio f√≠sico e as habilidades motoras exigidas pelo jogo e b) a atratividade como uma atividade divertida e cativante, que ir√° atrair o jogador e faz√™-lo permanecer imerso na narrativa do jogo. A ideia de atratividade em um jogo √© dependente da forma como a habilidade do jogador √© combinada com os desafios e com a narrativa do jogo e tamb√©m suportada pela teoria do fluxo desenvolvida por Csikszentmihalyi, em 1975, chamada de psicologia da √≥tima experi√™ncia. Segundo esse autor, durante a experi√™ncia de fluxo, como um estado mental, perdemos a no√ß√£o do tempo e as preocupa√ß√µes, de fato, nosso n√≠vel de foco maximiza o nosso desempenho e sensa√ß√£o de prazer da atividade, o fluxo √© tamb√©m chamado de experi√™ncia ideal, ou estar na "zona de fluxo". Com base nos conceitos apontados, as propostas para o uso de EXG em rede, na Educa√ß√£o F√≠sica a dist√¢ncia e e-learning, devem envolver uma adequa√ß√£o educacional, que pode ser realizada atrav√©s do uso de estrat√©gias instrucionais [Dick et al., 2001]. EXG (consoles e jogos) em rede e sua utilidade para a Educa√ß√£o F√≠sica, com vistas a: a) Investigar as capacidades f√≠sicas exigidas nos jogos; b) Classificar os jogos de acordo com o CEF e explorar a possibilidade de utiliza√ß√£o na educa√ß√£o a dist√¢ncia e e-learning; c) Explorar a Teoria do Fluxo como par√¢metro para uma experi√™ncia positiva em ambiente de aprendizagem virtual on-line. Trout e Zamora [2005] relataram que algumas escolas no estado da Calif√≥rnia, EUA, inclu√≠ram em seus programas de EF o game Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), como integrante do curr√≠culo. Outro estudo tamb√©m foi realizado em vinte escolas da Virg√≠nia Ocidental (EUA), acerca do uso de DDR e sua rela√ß√£o com a sa√∫de; resultados mostraram que alguns alunos perderam gordura corporal ap√≥s usarem o jogo na escola [Liberman, 2006]. O console EXG difere dos videogames sedent√°rios [Bidiss & Irwin, 2010], devido ao esfor√ßo f√≠sico e √†s capacidades f√≠sicas exigidas pelo jogo. Na verdade, todos os videogames demandam atividade cognitiva e tempo de rea√ß√£o auditivo e visual, al√©m da coordena√ß√£o dos dedos para a manipula√ß√£o do joystick durante o jogo. No entanto, o console EXG exige outras capacidades f√≠sicas, como a resist√™ncia, a coordena√ß√£o de membros superiores e inferiores, a velocidade, a for√ßa, o equil√≠brio e a flexibilidade para suportar a jogabilidade e o enredo dos games. A habilidade motora para jogar EXG envolve a utiliza√ß√£o de um conjunto de capacidades f√≠sicas; assim, cada game exige n√≠veis diferenciados de capacidades. Optou-se, nesta pesquisa, por apresentar as capacidades f√≠sicas mais evidentes em cada jogo investigado. Outro aspecto interessante que potencializa o gasto cal√≥rico √© o aumento da V dos bra√ßos para executar os golpes de boxe, associado a um tempo prolongado de exerc√≠cio, j√° que vencer o jogo implica lutar contra novo advers√°rio ou inimigo. Outros jogos de luta com jogabilidade em rede s√£o Kinect Sports (boxing), Deca Sports Freedom (boxing) e Deca Sports 3 (fencing); todos eles exigem um trabalho de R. Assim como os games de dan√ßa, os de luta s√£o os games com maior gasto cal√≥rico e s√£o citados como ferramentas eficazes na promo√ß√£o da sa√∫de e atividade f√≠sica [Graves et al., 2007; Lanningham-Foster et al., 2009]. dist√¢ncia e e-learning Huizinga [2005] relata que o jogo habita a vida de diferentes institui√ß√µes educativas formais e informais e ainda faz parte da sociabilidade humana de maneira l√∫dica, alegre e prazerosa. Os EXG investigados nesta pesquisa permitem que os CEF possam ser transportados para o ciberespa√ßo, possibilitando que conte√∫dos te√≥rico-pr√°ticos da EF sejam trabalhados a dist√¢ncia. A constata√ß√£o admite que, assim como no Second Life, indiv√≠duos separados geograficamente possam se encontrar para uma reuni√£o em um ambiente virtual; jogadores tamb√©m podem se encontrar em um ambiente virtual para um jogo de t√™nis em dupla, sendo um deles o professor. Silveira e Torres [2007] investigaram os jogos eletr√¥nicos na Educa√ß√£o F√≠sica escolar e os resultados da pesquisa indicam a necessidade de as escolas refletirem sobre a sele√ß√£o dos jogos eletr√¥nicos como conte√∫do, oferecendo possibilidades de educar os jovens para a cultura eletr√¥nica que, a exemplo de outras formas culturais, interferem na capacidade de os sujeitos perceberem a realidade.[ em disciplinas como Fisiologia do Exerc√≠cio e Bioqu√≠mica. Games como arco e flecha e a maioria dos esportes de tiro s√£o exemplos envolvendo a complexidade do controle motor e da performance na disciplina de Aprendizagem Motora, al√©m do Guitar Hero, que permite o aprendizado de habilidades motoras finas. O Wii Fit possui games que permitem realizar movimentos de ioga em uma plataforma que mensura, al√©m da massa corporal, o centro de press√£o da for√ßa-peso na √°rea da base de sustenta√ß√£o, sendo o equil√≠brio vari√°vel fundamental no entendimento do movimento humano em disciplinas como Biomec√¢nica. O game √© uma experi√™ncia autot√©lica por natureza, o jogador joga por puro prazer, n√£o espera nada em troca, desta forma busca-se discutir as ferramentas e meios com potencial para produzir no aluno essa motiva√ß√£o. Apesar da import√¢ncia do Fluxo para o engajamento do aluno no aprendizado e do jogador no game, apenas uma pesquisa, no grupo Design de EXG, apresentou um prot√≥tipo no qual os designers utilizaram o fluxo como par√¢metro de engajamento e divers√£o.},

  Review                   = {Sensors and In-Home Collection of Health Data: A Privacy by Design Approach --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As tags de RFID s√£o bastante utilizadas par come√ßar a implementar sensores de seguran√ßa. Um dos problemas de RFID √© que possui dados est√°ticos em detrimento a outras m√≠dias Importante: Os sensores podem ser definidos de dois tipos: - Behavioural sensors: que atrav√©s da detec√ß√£o de movimento consegue identificar um padr√£o de a√ß√£o - Charecteristic sensors- que medem os atributos fisiol√≥gicos do indiv√≠duo: temperatura, press√£o sang√º√≠nea, n√≠vel de stress, glicose. Esses sensores armazenam ou reagem ao dado adquirido. Existem benef√≠cios significantes advindos das tecnologias de home health care (essas tecnolgoias prov√™em o suporte sem a presen√ßa de um cl√≠nico). Os custos com atendimento de sa√∫de s√£o reduzidos tanto para os planos de sa√∫deo quanto para o indiv√≠duo. Isto est√° associado ao tempo dispon√≠vel, necessidade de ir a uma cl√≠nica para atendimento, al√©m de ser um tratamento preventivo atrav√©s da detec√ß√£o das adversidades cl√≠nicas [1, 2].

  Review                   = {A maioria dos m√©todos utilizados para avaliar a DP, necessitam do expertise humano, como por exemplo no uso da UPDRS. A an√°lise das caracter√≠sticas de movimento, documentada por Knutsson (1972), demonstra que os pacientes da DP, exibem uma larga variabilidade de movimento compara as pessoas normais. Esles caminham mais devagar a passos mais curtos e a amplitude de movimento das articula√ß√µes √© diminu√≠da. Isso especifica um padr√£o de movimento, largamente aceito como caracter√≠stica proeminente da doen√ßa. (McDowell, 1971). Entretando, a postura do movimento pode variar de pessoa para pessoa, a avalia√ß√£o de movimento do parkisoniando tende a ser subjetiva e depende fortemente do expertis de julgamento do m√©dico (Blin, Ferrandez, & Serratrice, 1990; Lubik et al., 2006; Melnick, Radtka, & Piper, 2002; Shan et al., 2001; Salarian et al., 2004; Sofuwa et al., 2005; Stern et al., 1983; Vokaer, Azar, & Beyl, 2003). As a result, engineering-oriented machine learning-based methods have attracted more and more attention in this field (Engin et al., 2007; Fahrenberg et al., 1997; Makikawa & Iizumi, 1995; Sekine et al., 2002; Veltink et al., 1996). Many previous studies have used dc and ac accelerometers to assess gait patterns. They classified the accelerometer signals into different typesof walking and correlated them with energy consumption. Nevertheless, those methods often used a number of sensors, causing patient discomfort. The aim of this paper is to discriminate PD patients from normal subjects using a vision-based gait analysis approach. The scheme utilizes the holistic image of subjects, and extracts and reduces the feature space by using PCA and LDA. The meaning of the obtained LDA transformation matrix (reduced to a vector in our case) is not only treated as a black box but is also used to describe the posture information of PD patients in a numerical way. O objetivo desse trabalho √© classificar o paciente de DP de pessoas normais usando an√°lise de movimento baseada em vis√£o. Esse esquema utiliza uma imagem hol√≠stica do sujeito, extrai e reduz a caracter√≠stica de espa√ßo usando PCA e LDA. O resultado obtido atrav√©s da transforma√ß√£o de matriz por LDA (reduzido em um vetor) √© utilizado para descrever a postura do paciente de forma num√©rica. O sistema utilizado para a detec√ß√£o de pacientes com parkinson, faz uso de pr√©-processamento, treinamento e reconhecimento. Nesse estudo primeiramente foram capturados v√≠deos de pessoas normais e pacientes com DP. Foi realiado um processamento de imagens de v√≠deos para caracterizar os sujeitos. Todos os sujeitos foram codificados em um vetor atrav√©s de PCA e LDA para extrair as caracter√≠sticas. Um Minimum distance classifier (MDC) foi usado como classificador. Aquisicao da Imagem Como mostra a figura... o ambiente consiste de um corredor azul bem iluminado. E equipamentos de aquisi√ß√£o de images incluindo uma c√¢mera CCD conectada ao PC e uma filmadora de m√£o. 4.

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of specific Parkinsonian gait patterns is helpful in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there are few computer-aided methods to identify the specific gait patterns of PD. We propose a vision-based diagnostic system to aid in recognition of the gait patterns of Parkinson's disease. The proposed system utilizes an algorithm combining principal component analysis (PCA) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This scheme not only addresses the high data dimensionality problem during image processing but also distinguishes different gait categories simultaneously. The feasibility of the proposed system for the recognition of PD gait was tested by using gait videos of PD and normal subjects. The efficiency of feature extraction using PCA and LDA coefficients are also compared. Experimental results showed that LDA had a recognition rate for Parkinsonian gait of 95.49%, which is higher than the conventional PCA feature extraction method. The proposed system is a promising aid in identifying the gait of Parkinson's disease patients and can discriminate the gait patterns of PD patients and normal people with a very high classification rate.},

  Abstract                 = {As redes de sensores sem fio, RSSFs, j√° s√£o uma realidade hoje em dia e representam uma ferramenta fundamental para monitorar sinais vitais de pacientes. Muitas aplica√ß√µes m√©dicas beneficiam-se de padr√µes baseados em tecnologias sem fio como o IEEE 802.15.4. Este trabalho consiste em produzir, atrav√©s de simula√ß√µes com o Network Simulator, NS, os documentos essenciais a um estudo para uma aplica√ß√£o m√©dica que envolve redes de sensores sem fio. Para isso s√£o realizadas simula√ß√µes em dois diferentes cen√°rios, utilizando m√©tricas como vaz√£o e taxa de entrega, com objetivo de definir a melhor configura√ß√£o de uma rede de sensores m√©dicos sem fio, que garanta a qualidade de servi√ßo, QoS, especificada para esse problema.},

  Review                   = {O objetivo deste trabalho √© simular, atrav√©s do Network Simulator: - duas diferentes topologias de rede - produzir os documentos essenciais a um estudo de viabilidade para uma aplica√ß√£o m√©dica Este trabalho √© embasado em : - conceitos relacionados as tecnologias sem fio - uso em rede de sensores sem fio, - padr√£o IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4. 2003], - al√©m de algumas no√ß√µes b√°sicas sobre rede de sensores sem fio aplicadas na assist√™ncia √° pacientes [European Commission 2004] [Kim 2007]. [ATEN√á√ÉO] Dentre os padr√µes de redes sem fio presentes no mercado destacam-se o ZigBee, Bluetooth, e Wi- Fi. Nas aplica√ß√µes de monitoramento com sensores sem fio, destas tecnologias o Wi-Fi apresenta um consumo de energia maior. Fatores como consumo de energia, baixa lat√™ncia e custo fazem do padr√£o ZigBee o mais adequado. O Bluetooth apesar de apresentar um baixo custo, alta lat√™ncia e consumo ainda elevado, n√£o o faz adequado a este tipo de aplica√ß√£o [Santos 2007] O trabalho √© baseado em aplica√ß√µes m√©dicas que n√£o necessitam de uma elevada taxa de dados. O estudo se baseia em m√©tricas como vaz√£o e taxa de entrega de dados com o objetivo de validar a especifica√ß√£o de uma rede de sensores m√©dicos que garanta qualidade de servi√ßo, QoS [European Commission 2004]. Redes Sensores Biom√©dicos -------------------------------------------- Uma rede de sensores m√©dicos √© formada por pequenos n√≥s sensores de baixa pot√™ncia, multifuncionais, que s√£o equipados por sensores biom√©dicos e possuem uma unidade de processamento [Ruzzelli 2007]. Sensores biom√©dicos s√£o usados para identificar mudan√ßas biol√≥gicas e monitorar par√¢metros biol√≥gicos em tecidos e √≥rg√£os. Estes dispositivos monitoraram par√¢metros como a press√£o sangu√≠nea, temperatura, entre outros. A implementa√ß√£o de uma rede de sensores biom√©dicos sem fio para atuar em uma aplica√ß√£o de monitoramento de pacientes pode requerer um certo desempenho em rela√ß√£o √°s m√©tricas: banda de rede, vaz√£o, qualidade do sinal, tempo de resposta, lat√™ncia, taxa de entrega de pacotes e varia√ß√£o do atraso entre pacotes [Ruzzelli 2007]. Simula√ß√£o ---------------- O objetivo da simula√ß√£o neste cen√°rio com 2 n√≥s foi o de se verificar a taxa de entrega e a taxa de dados para o dado cen√°rio que ser√° utilizado na especifica√ß√£o da rede. Cen√°rio 2 Tomando por base o resultado das simula√ß√µes do cen√°rio 1, o passo seguinte foi criar um outro cen√°rio em topologia estrela com os n√≥s fontes enviando pacotes diretamente para o coordenador da sub-rede, o qual dependendo dos resultados desta simula√ß√£o ser√° tamb√©m o n√≥ roteador conectado diretamente ao coordenador da rede de sensores m√©dicos. Coment√°rios -------------------- A rede ser√° formada por uma segunda topologia no formato estrela, nesta segunda parte para a especifica√ß√£o da rede de sensores s√£o usados cen√°rios na topologia mencionada que se diferenciam pela quantidade de n√≥s fontes. De acordo com os resultados dos cen√°rios simulados, poderemos montar a rede de sensores, com um computador central, equipado com um m√≥dulo que dar√° suporte ao padr√£o ZigBee baseado na defini√ß√£o 802.15.4 do IEEE, que receber√° atrav√©s do coordenador da sub-rede estrela os dados transmitidos de 4 n√≥s fontes ECG formadores desta sub-rede que estar√£o no corpo do paciente para a coleta dos dados como mostrado na Figura 3.4. Conclus√µes ------------------ O trabalho √© focado no estudo de uma aplica√ß√£o m√©dica que garanta a qualidade de servi√ßo, atrav√©s do uso das m√©tricas como vaz√£o de dados e taxa de entrega do padr√£o IEEE 802.15.4. Foram simulados dois cen√°rios, o primeiro ponto-a-ponto e de acordo com seus resultados foi criado o segundo cen√°rio do tipo estrela; a integra√ß√£o destes foi utilizada para a especifica√ß√£o da rede de sensores m√©dicos sem fio com o m√≠nimo de confiabilidade poss√≠vel com base em seus resultados. Para se estimar uma taxa de envio de dados para a determinada aplica√ß√£o a taxa de entrega considerada dever√° estar acima de 90%, para prover certa confiabilidade no desempenho. Este estudo pode servir de consulta para elabora√ß√£o de trabalhos futuros. PEGAR ---------- [European Commission 2004] O objetivo destas simula√ß√µes √© produzir documentos necess√°rios a um estudo que viabilize a especifica√ß√£o para uma aplica√ß√£o m√©dica que garanta qualidade de servi√ßo. Com o uso das m√©tricas vaz√£o de dados e taxa de entrega do IEEE 802.15.4 em alguns cen√°rios adequados √† aplica√ß√£o de monitoramento de sinais fisiol√≥gicos vitais de pacientes.},

V√°rios m√©todos foram aplicados para avaliar esses scores. In literature, it is claimed that approximately 90% of people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease exhibit some form of vocal impairment (Ho, Iansek, Marigliani, Bradshaw, & Gates, 1998; Little et al., 2008). The people with Parkinson‚Äôs typically display a constellation of vocal symptom that includes impairment in the normal production of vocal sounds, which is dysphonia. The voice will sound hoarse, strained or effortful. The voice may be difficult to understand because their voice sounds very quiet or is so distinctive that it distracts from the content of what the person is saying. In these studies, the speech sounds produced during standard speech tests are recorded using a microphone, and the recorded speech signals are subsequently analyzed using measurement methods (implemented in software algorithms) designed to detect certain properties of these signals. Methods from statistical learning theory are proposed such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) (Hastie et al., 2001). dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders. This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals (‚Äò‚Äòname‚Äù column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to ‚Äò‚Äòstatus‚Äù column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around six recordings per patient; the name of the patient is identified in the first column. DMNeural node is to perform both principal component analysis and DMneural network training. Principal component modelling is based on constructing an independent linear of input variables in which the coefficients capture the maximum amount of variability in the data. DMneural network training is an additive nonlinear model that uses a set of principal components that are placed into separate buckets to predict either a binary-valued or interval valued target variable. Decision tree node provides a completely different approach to classification. A decision tree develops a series of if-then rules. Each rule assigns an observation to one segment of the tree, at which point another if-then rule is applied. The initial segment, containing the entire data set, is the root node for the decision tree. Conclus√£o: Moreover a comparative study was aimed indeed. The neural network classifier yielded the best score. The experimental results gained 92.9% classification accuracy for neural networks. Another comparative study was also conducted},

As such systems become more widespread, with multiple healthcare providers and security domains, the establishment of trust between users, providers and medical staff will become important. In this paper we implement the ETTG privacy-preserving trust negotiation protocol and show how it can be used to automatically establish mutual trust between interacting parties in compliance with access-control and disclosure policies. The protocol is implemented in Java and can be run on J2ME platforms. The trust negotiation steps are logged and the resulting trust graphs can be visualised to show how policy compliance was achieved. We also develop a new easier-to-understand syntax for ETTG and use it to define access-control and disclosure policies for a small pervasive healthcare scenario.},

O neurologista dever√° ser consultado para que se possa definir se h√° necessidade de rem√©dios e quais dever√£o ser empregados. A doen√ßa de Parkinson √© uma condi√ß√£o cr√¥nica. A evolu√ß√£o dos sintomas √© usualmente lenta, mas √© vari√°vel em cada caso. A doen√ßa de Parkinson √© a forma mais freq√ºente de parkinsonismo. Doen√ßa de Parkinson e parkinsonismo n√£o s√£o sin√¥nimos. Parkinsonismo √© um termo gen√©rico que designa uma s√©rie de doen√ßas com causas diferentes e que t√™m em comum a presen√ßa de sintomas parkinsonianos (ou seja, aqueles sintomas encontrados na doen√ßa de Parkinson). A doen√ßa de Parkinson √© uma das muitas formas de parkinsonismo e tamb√©m a mais freq√ºente. Corresponde a cerca de 75% de todas as formas de parkinsonismo. Como n√£o se conhece a causa da doen√ßa de Parkinson, ela √© tamb√©m chamada de parkinsonismo prim√°rio. O mal de Parkinson √© tamb√©m chamado de parkinsonismo prim√°rio porque √© uma doen√ßa para a qual nenhuma causa conhecida foi identificada. Por outro lado, se diz que um parkinsonismo √© secund√°rio naqueles casos em que uma causa pode ser identificada. Cerca de 75% de todas as formas de parkinsonismo correspondem √† forma prim√°ria. Preven√ß√£o ---------------- N√£o existe a preven√ß√£o para a Doen√ßa de Parkinson, existe a perspectiva de que em breve possa identificar os indiv√≠duos com maiores chances de desenvolver a doen√ßa, e assim no futuro poder√° desenvolver drogas que impedissem, ou pelo menos atrasassem, o aparecimento dos sintomas. Tratamento da Doen√ßa de Parkinson ---------------------------------------------------------- O tratamento √© feito com medica√ß√µes que controlam os sintomas. O m√©dico disp√µe hoje de um arsenal que √© suficiente para controlar o problema da grande maioria dos pacientes. Esses medicamentos s√£o freq√ºentemente usados em combina√ß√£o e muitos pacientes usam simultaneamente de duas a quatro medica√ß√µes diferentes. Para que isso d√™ certo √© preciso que o m√©dico conhe√ßa bem os problemas da doen√ßa e saiba utilizar as drogas adequadamente SINTOMAS INICIAIS ---------------------------- Os primeiros sintomas da doen√ßa de Parkinson t√™m in√≠cio de modo quase impercept√≠vel o que faz com que o pr√≥prio paciente n√£o consiga identificar o in√≠cio preciso das primeiras manifesta√ß√µes. Muitas vezes, amigos ou familiares s√£o os primeiros a notar as primeiras mudan√ßas. OS PRIMEIROS SINAIS PODEM SER UM OU MAIS DOS SEGUINTES: 1- Sensa√ß√£o de cansa√ßo ou mal-estar no fim do dia 2- Caligrafia menos leg√≠vel ou com tamanho diminu√≠do 3- Fala mon√≥tona e menos articulada 4- Depress√£o ou isolamento sem motivo aparente 5- Lapsos de mem√≥ria, dificuldade de concentra√ß√£o e irritabilidade 6- Dores musculares, principalmente na regi√£o lombar. 7- Um dos bra√ßos ou uma perna movimenta-se menos do que a do outro lado 8- Express√£o facial perde a espontaneidade 9- Diminui√ß√£o da freq√º√™ncia dos piscamentos 10- Movimentos tornam-se mais vagarosos, a pessoa permanece por mais tempo em uma mesma posi√ß√£o},

Continuous monitoring of human movement can provide valuable information relevant to individual's level of physical activity and functional ability. Traditionally, orientation has been calculated by integrating the angular velocity from gyroscopes. However, a small drift in the measured velocity leads to large integration errors that grow with time. To compensate for that drift, complementary data from accelerometers are normally fused into the tracking systems using the Kalman or extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this study, we combine kinematic models designed for control of robotic arms with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to continuously estimate the angles of human shoulder and elbow using two wearable sensors. This methodology can easily be generalized to track other human joints. We validate the method with an optical motion tracking system and demonstrate correlation consistently greater than 0.9 between the two systems.},

  Abstract                 = {{ There has been increased research interest in the use of active video games (in which players physically interact with images onscreen) as a means to promote physical activity in children. The aim of this review was to assess active video games as a means of increasing energy expenditure and physical activity behavior in children. Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. The last search was conducted in December 2008. Eleven studies focused on the quantification of the energy cost associated with playing active video games, and eight studies focused on the utility of active video games as an intervention to increase physical activity in children. Compared with traditional nonactive video games, active video games elicited greater energy expenditure, which was similar in intensity to mild to moderate intensity physical activity. The intervention studies indicate that active video games may have the potential to increase free-living physical activity and improve body composition in children; however, methodological limitations prevent definitive conclusions. Future research should focus on larger, methodologically sound intervention trials to provide definitive answers as to whether this technology is effective in promoting long-term physical activity in children. }},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND: The ability to maintain a steady gait rhythm is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This aspect of locomotor dyscontrol, which likely reflects impaired automaticity in PD, can be quantified by measuring the stride-to-stride variability of gait timing. Previous work has shown an increase in both the variability of the stride time and swing time in PD, but the origins of these changes are not fully understood. Patients with PD also generally walk with a reduced gait speed, a potential confounder of the observed changes in variability. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between walking speed and gait variability. METHODS: Stride time variability and swing time variability were measured in 36 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-2.5) and 30 healthy controls who walked on a treadmill at four different speeds: 1) Comfortable walking speed (CWS), 2) 80\% of CWS 3) 90\% of CWS, and 4) 110\% of CWS. In addition, we studied the effects of walking slowly on level ground, both with and without a walker. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, increased variability of stride time and swing time was observed in the patients with PD in CWS, compared to controls. In both groups, there was a small but significant association between treadmill gait speed and stride time variability such that higher speeds were associated with lower (better) values of stride time variability (p = 0.0002). In contrast, swing time variability did not change in response to changes in gait speed. Similar results were observed with walking on level ground. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that swing time variability is independent of gait speed, at least over the range studied, and therefore, that it may be used as a speed-independent marker of rhythmicity and gait steadiness. Since walking speed did not affect stride time variability and swing time variability in the same way, it appears that these two aspects of gait rhythmicity are not entirely controlled by the same mechanisms. The present findings also suggest that the increased gait variability in PD is disease-related, and not simply a consequence of bradykinesia.}},

  Review                   = {Abstract‚ÄîNonobtrusive options for monitoring the wrist and hand movement are needed for stroke rehabilitation and other applications. We describe an approach to estimate the wrist and finger joint angles using a radial basis function network that maps differential magnetometer readings to joint angles. Manumeter estimates scaled proportionally to the intensity of hand activity. Estimates of angular excursion made with the manumeter were 92.5% ¬± 28.4 (SD), 98.3% ¬± 23.3, and 94.7% ¬± 19.3 of the goniometric exoskeleton across the three testing days, respectively. Currently, questionnaires such as the Motor Activity Log (MAL) are used to assess daily use of the upper and lower extremity after neurologic injuries such as stroke. The MAL is an interview that asks subjects to rate on an ordinal scale how much and how well they use their impaired arms to accomplish activities of daily living [5]. This test relies on subjective interpretation that can lead to inconsistent assessment results [6]‚Äì[8]. To address these limitations, we developed a nonobtrusive device to monitor daily use of the hand and wrist in an uncontrolled environment. Here, we use the new term ‚Äúmanumeter‚Äù to refer to a device used to measure the (angular) distance traveled by joints of the hand (Latin: ‚Äúmanus‚Äù), mimicing the existing term ‚Äúpedometer,‚Äù which refers to a device that measures the distance travelled by foot (Latin: ‚Äúpedites‚Äù). The manumeter described here uses a magnetic sensing system that is packaged in a socially acceptable ring and watch-like unit (see Fig. 1). IV. D ISCUSSION We tested the concept that magnetometers mounted at the wrist can detect the magnetic field produced by a ring worn on the finger, and then, be used to infer the angles of the wrist and finger joints. The angle estimates calculated from this approach correlated strongly with those calculated from a goniometric ex-oskeleton, although the finger flexion/extension estimates were least accurate. Accuracy levels were maintained a week after the initial calibration without recalibration. The system presented here is unique in several ways. The signal processing algorithm developed can convert low magnetic field strength signals (0.3‚Äì0.6 G) into hand and wrist joint estimates, while other systems have relied on high magnetic field strength signals (up to 33 G) [44], [47]. For this reason, we need only a small magnetic ring to generate the magnetic field. This is also apparently the first proposed system that can log finger and wrist angles in an unrestricted environment without the use of electronics on the fingers. B. Accuracy of the Manumeter We analyzed the accuracy of the manumeter in two ways. First, we compared its estimate of total joint distance traveled to that of the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù goniometric exoskeleton, and found it was 92%‚Äì98% accurate on average across subjects, with a 19%‚Äì28% standard deviation.

In this paper we present the health game ‚Äò‚ÄòBalance‚Äô‚Äô, developed to optimize the self-management of teenagers with diabetes mellitus type-I. Two versions of the game were implemented: A version explicitly referring to diabetes and an implicit version of ‚Äò‚ÄòBalance‚Äô‚Äô with no diabetes content in order to reduce diabetes related reactance among juveniles. In a between-subjects experimental study with a clinical sample the two versions were compared. Results demonstrate, contrary to expectations, that the explicit game version yielded higher game enjoyment than the implicit version.},

Os sistemas de an√°lise de movimento existentes al√©m de caro, s√£o intrusivo e requerem ambientes controleados como uma cl√≠nica ou laborat√≥rio. Nesse trabalho √© apresentado o Kinnect como um sensor capaz de extrair informa√ß√µes de movimento de todas as partes do corpo. - Eless desenvolveram um baateria para instalar uma base e monitorar o movimento em casa. - A an√°lise do movimento humano se mostrou como um importante indicador de sa√∫de aplicado em diversos contextos como: diabetes, doen√ßas neurol√≥gicas e detec√ß√£o/predi√ß√£o de quedas. - √â proposto um sistema de baixo custo, n√£o intrusivo que pode mensurar com precis√£√µ o movimento por interm√©dio do Kinect - Preciso e n√£o invasivo, existem diversas aplica√ß√µes de diagn√≥stico, monitoramento, tratamento e reabilita√ß√£o. Tais aplica√ß√µes permitem incluir diagn√≥stico precoce, avalia√ß√£o e gerenciamento medicamentoso em casa, otimizando o tratatamento. A t√©cnica utilizada no artigo, usa informa√ß√£o de toddo o corpo para melhorar a precis√£o. Al√©m do mais, eles conseguem demonstrar medi√ß√µes da cinem√°tica do bra√ßo, par√¢metros que s√£o √∫teis apra aplcia√ß√µes m√©dicas. Nesse trabalho os autores demonstraram a habilidade de extrair um conjunto ricos de par√¢metros, como o swing do bra√ßo por exemplo. Al√©m do mais essa proposta √© n√£o intrusiva dependendo do uso como um sensor posto numa posi√ß√£o fixa na casa. -Nesse trabalho o autor testou a robustez e acur√°cia do esqueleto disponibilizado pelo Kinnect e comprovou sua efic√°cia para aplica√ß√µes de diagn√≥stico e monitoramento de sa√∫de.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks are going to allow for ubiquitous health monitoring, improving users' well-being, the healthcare system, and helping to quickly react on emergency situations. Meeting the strict security needs of these ubiquitous medical applications is a big challenge, since safety and privacy of medical data has to be guaranteed all the way from the sensor nodes to the back-end services, the system has to fulfill latency needs, and lots of mobility is expected. In this paper, we introduce a deployment model for wireless sensor networks for pervasive healthcare based on the concepts of patient area networks and medical sensor networks, and propose a complete and efficient security framework for them. Our security framework is organized into three layers, addressing the operational requirements and security needs at the patient area network, medical sensor network and back-end levels. We specify how these layers are interconnected with each other as well as the needed security mechanisms that allow for the efficient and practical deployment of secure pervasive healthcare systems based on wireless sensor networks.},

Tanto usu√°rios quanto m√©dicos devem autenticar qualquer acesso ou escrita das informa√ß√µes m√©dicas. Esses requisitos de seguran√ßa s√£o requeridos pela HITRUST e as diretivas legais da HIPAA ============================== O autor prop√µe um framework para sistemas pervasivos baseados em WSN. Combinanando uma uma solu√ß√£o centralizada e distribu√≠da balanceando performance e os requisitos de seguran√ßa. O framework possui uma arquitetura de seguran√ßa em tr√™s camadas: 1. Gerenciamento de seguran√ßa da MSN 2. Gerenciamento de Seguran√ßa da PAN 3. Gerenciamento de seguran√ßa dos mecanismos de back-end ==== O staff m√©dico pode se comunicar a qualquer PAN, mesmo que tanto PAN e m√©dicos estejam em constante movimento. PAN Security Layer: permite que o usu√°rio gerencie a seguran√ßa sua pr√≥pria pan, permitindo que ele conceda ou negue o acesso aos dados ao interatgir ocm a MSNs e os sistemas de Back End. The Back-end services security layer, assegura que as opera√ß√µes sobre a PAN interaja entre as MSN controlando diversas organiza√ß√µes. O autor assumiu um modelo centralizado e simplificado baseado na infraestrutura de chave p√∫blica e gerenciamento de certifica√ß√£o de autoridade no gerenciamento do sistema de healthcare. MSN Security Layer ----------------------------- A abordagem b√°sica dessa camada permitiu combinar um handshake de acordo e verifica√ß√£o leve de certificados. Security Handshake baseado em criptografia de chave p√∫blica requere alguns segundos dos sensores e um delay para evitar ataques DoS. PAN Security Layer ---------------------------- A segunda camada de seguran√ßa √© centrada-no-paciente para controla a camada PAN enquanto interage com as MSNs, no instance que controla a MSNs associadas aos usu√°rios das PAN asseguranca o link de comunica√ß√£o entre eles. ===========================},

  Review                   = {Nesse artigo o autor defende que o uso comercial dos jogos de esporte e sa√∫de t√™m-se tornado produtos de sucesso. Avalia√ß√µes de trabalhos cient√≠ficos como os de Baranowski e Kato, tem provado efeitos positivos quando os jogos s√£o abordados em dire√ß√µes de modificar o comportamento dos jogadores. Trabalhos de Papastergiou, Kretchscman, Kliem e Wiemeyer tamb√©m indicamo efeitos positivos para reabilita√ß√£o com Wii Sports box ou o potencial do Wii Fit como treinamento para a preven√ß√£o e reabilita√ß√£o. Contudo esses jogos t√™m limita√ß√µes porque n√£o s√£o substitutos adequados dos esportes reais, e os obst√°culos concretos desses sistemas pode personlizar e sustenatar uma motiva√ß√£o sustent√°vels desses jogos quando aplicados √† sa√∫de. Baseado nessa observa√ß√£o, esse trabalho prima em levantar as dificuldades e efeitos positivos em combinar os jogos s√©rios de esportes e sa√∫de com as tecnologias de sensores, para a personaliza√ß√£o e adapta√ß√£o de jogos multiplayer. A partir da aplica√ß√£o StoryTec, m√©dicos, preparadores f√≠sicos e outros usu√°rios podem definir o programa de exerc√≠cio atrav√©s de programas pre-configurados e base de dados das caracter√≠sticas individuais ou do grupo. Elaborando a Story Engine do jogo, essa engine serve como um control unit para diversor momentos do jogo, respons√°vel em processar o controle de dados vitais restrito a camada de sensores da aplica√ß√£o. Segundo o trabalho de Sinclair [12], os jogos comerciais de exergames, n√£o deve utiliz√°-lo apenas como motivacional para a pr√°tica de exerc√≠cio mas tamb√©m para mensurar seu batimento card√≠aco, reconhcer atividades via aceler√¥metros. Um dos problemas √© que esses sinais n√£o s√£o considerados no gameplay dos exergames. Para esse prop√≥sito √© proposto uma engine adaptativa que recupera os sinais vitais para influenciar diretamente no game-play. Personaliza√ß√£o e Adapta√ß√£o ================== O objetivo dessa abordagem √© prover um ambiente adaptado e personalizado que considera informa√ß√£o estat√≠stca (treinamento, logica) e din√¢mica como os sinais vitais que potencialmente altera o comportamento do jogador. Conclus√£o ======= O objetivo dessa abordagem √© prover um ambiente adaptado e personalizado que considera informa√ß√£o estat√≠stca (treinamento, logica) e din√¢mica como os sinais vitais que potencialmente altera o comportamento do jogador. Esse artigo introduz um conjunto de exergames que buscam motivar os jogadores a praticarem exerc√≠cio de forma personalizada atrav√©s dos dados capturados pelos sensores.},

  Review                   = {Motivation and Video Games Video games motivate a remarkable amount of goal-directed behavior. For example, every week well over 10 million players of the popular online game World of Warcraft forgo other opportunities for leisure and invest more than 225 million hours collaborating, exploring, and competing against one another in a virtual world. Why do so many people spend so much time engaged in such games? The immediate and most obvious answer is ‚Äúbecause they are fun.‚Äù Indeed, video game play differs markedly from activities that are engaged in for some form of external reward (e.g., payment for work). According to SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2000b), behaviors pursued for their own sake or their inherent satisfaction are identified as intrinsically motivated, whereas those pursued to access desired end states or avoid aversive ones are understood as extrinsically motivated. For more than 3 decades, one subtheory of SDT, cognitive evaluation theory (CET), has guided research on intrinsic motivation in sports, education, and leisure domains. The motivational model we propose for video games is based on the premise that the principles of CET and SDT that have been applied to the study of intrinsically motivated behaviors are also relevant to the psychological functioning and well-being of players engaged with video games},

In this paper, we address the challenges of adding context awareness to Serious Games for Sport and Health. We propose a framework for social networks and web services that is specialized in capturing temporal and spatial context as well as vital parameters of a user. Our framework dynamically maps necessary e-Health services such as exergames. In this way, we assist a user to find the most appropriate health services according to his/her needs at anytime and anywhere. We present our initial proof of concept implementation of the framework, which includes new sensor based Serious Games for Sport and Health as well as our test results.},

  Review                   = {O autor apresenta um framework para construir informa√ß√£o baseada em contexto chamando de SocialAware. Esse framework foi testado numa aplica√ßa√µ de prova de conceito. Estudos multidisciplinares recentes, tem pesquisado no dom√≠nio de redes sensores sem-fio, smart phones, redes sociais e comunica√ß√£o m√≥vel. Esses estudos contribu√≠ram em capturar sinais vitais como: batimento card√≠aco, press√£o sangu√≠nea, n√≠vel de glicose e etc. Al√©m disso, atividades como andar, dormir, dirigir, cair, correr falar e conversar com um amigo pode ser capturado assim como vari√°veis de ambiente como temperatura, humidade, localiza√ß√£o, altitude e etc. Nesse artigo √© apresentado uma integra√ß√£o com um conjunto de jogos s√©rios para o suporte ao esporte e a sa√∫de e √© utilizado a informa√ß√£o de contexto para o framework. Extrair informa√ß√£o de contexto atrav√©s de sensores em servi√ßos heterog√™neos tr√°s dois desafios. Primeiramente, requer extrair conte√∫do de servi√ßos distintis e an√°lise de BSN. Segundo, extrair informa√ß√£o de redes sociais agregar e armazenar no reposit√≥rio espec√≠fico e extrair informa√ß√£o relevante num jogo s√©rio ou servi√ßo de sa√∫de. M√≥dulo de Extra√ß√£o de Conte√∫do ===================== This module takes part in the actual content extraction process from heterogeneous Internet-based services and body sensor network. M√≥dulo de Extra√ß√£o de Contexto ===================== Esse m√≥dulo emprega o padr√£o de design MVC2 para encontrar valores de contexto baseados em servi√ßo. O Context Extrator extrai informa√ß√µes da BSN e dos servi√ßos atrav√©s de seus controladores. M√≥dulo de Servi√ßo de Adapta√ß√£o Din√¢mica =========================== Para compor as primitivas de contexto no desenvolvimento do portal de rede social chamado SenseFace, √© utilizado para mapear um subconjunto de jogos s√©rios e/ou servi√ßos de sa√∫de. E atrav√©s da Ubiquity Stack prov√™ uma subcamada de rede ub√≠qua para cada pessoa. Essa pilha prov√™ a l√≥gica, protocolos e algoritmos para extrair as informa√ß√µes de esporte e sa√∫de dos dados personalizados dos servi√ßos. Implementa√ß√£o ========== Devido a todas as camadas da pilha serem implementadas em PHP, foi usado um framework PHP chamado XAMPP, que atua diretamente no servidor WEB. A Gui foi implementada usando um Web Portal open Source denominado iMoogle, que utiliza PHP e JSON. O sistema armazena as informa√ß√µes vitais [17, 15, 21] como sensores foram utilizados po rel√≥gio Ez-430 Chronos Sports e a bicicleta ergom√©trica Daum 8008 TRS 3. A partir desses dispositivos foi poss√≠vel mensurar a atividade f√≠sica de uma pessoa. Foi implementado uma interface RESTful para transmitir os dados do aceler√¥metro em tempo real [15]. Dessa maneira foi poss√≠vel detectar longos per√≠odos de calmaria e de exerc√≠cio f√≠sico. A interface RESTful permite sugerir a execu√ß√£o de atividades como caminhar, jogar determinado game, pilates. Test Results ======== Para avaliar a efetividade do sistema proposta foram conduzidos uma amostra de 95 pessas 25% de mulheres e conduziram entre 15 de maio de 2010 a 30 de novembro de 2010. A maior dos usu√°rios possu√≠am mais de 25 anos e 45 usu√°rios menos de 25 anos. Todos os participantes utilizam servi√ßo de internet em diferentes escalas nos √∫tlims 4 a 6 anos. A id√©ia do servi√ßo din√¢mico sugere que os exerc√≠cios f√≠sicos sugeridos atrav√©s do jogo s√©rio foi fortemente aceitado por 65% dos usu√°rios, 30% consentiram e somente 5% acharam inapropriado. Conclus√£o ======= O autor demonstrou que √© poss√≠vel desenvolver uma aplica√ß√£o que use diferentes tecnologias para capturar o contexto e aplic√°-lo para atividades f√≠sicas. E que essa aplica√ß√£o foi aceita pela maioria dos usu√°rios que acharam adequado praticar exerc√≠cio f√≠sicos em determinados momentos. Ingl√™s ==== The author presents a framework for building context-aware services, called Social Aware. The framework has been tested with two proof-of-concept applications. Recent advancements in multidisciplinary research domains such as wireless sensors, smartphones, high speed personal area networking and mobile communication have contributed to a new era of context-aware computing. Extracting user context from sensory data and multimedia information contained within heterogeneous services poses two challenges. First, it requires live extraction of multimedia content from heterogeneous services and from BSN for context analysis. Second, employing appropriate logic to extract contextual information from the available social network and sensory data, aggregate and then store them to a repository to be used for dynamic selection of relevant serious games and health services. For better representation of the concept, we describe the framework with three logical modules. The first module deals with the extraction of multimedia data from different services over the web and live sensory data from one‚Äôs BSN},

  Abstract                 = {In a 5-year, double-blind study, subjects with Parkinson's disease ({PD)} who were randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole had a significantly lower incidence of dyskinesia compared with subjects randomized to levodopa, although Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS)} motor scores were significantly more improved in the levodopa group. Subjects who completed the original study were eligible to participate in a long-term extension study conducted according to an open, naturalistic design and were evaluated approximately every 6 months until they had been followed for a total of 10 years. Comparing subjects randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole (n = 42) and levodopa (n = 27), the incidence of dyskinesia was significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted odds ratio [{OR]} = 0.3; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]:} 0.1, 1.0; P = 0.046) and the median time to dyskinesia was significantly longer (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.4; 95\% {CI:} 0.2, 0.8; P = 0.007). The incidence of at least moderate wearing off ("off" time {\textgreater}/=26\% of the awake day) was also significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted {OR} = 0.3; 95\% {CI:} 0.09, 0.03; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in change in {UPDRS} activities of daily living or motor scores, or scores for the 39-item {PD} questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression, or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Early treatment decisions for individual patients depend largely on the anticipated risk of side effects and long-term complications. Both ropinirole and levodopa are viable treatment options in early {PD.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Research groups in both academia and industry have developed prototype systems to demonstrate the benefits of pervasive computing in various application domains. Unfortunately, many first-generation pervasive computing systems lack the ability to evolve as new technologies emerge or as an application domain matures. To address this limitation, the University of Florida's Mobile and Pervasive Computing Laboratory is developing programmable pervasive spaces in which a smart space exists as both a runtime environment and a software library. Service discovery and gateway protocols automatically integrate system components using generic middleware that maintains a service definition for each sensor and actuator in the space. The Gator Tech Smart House in Gainesville, Florida, is the culmination of more than five years of research in pervasive and mobile computing. The project's goal is to create assistive environments such as homes that can sense themselves and their residents and enact mappings between the physical world and remote monitoring and intervention services.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Our objective was to develop parameters for objective ambulatory measurements of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-three PD patients with mild to severe LID were submitted to a standardized protocol of 1-minute recordings during rest, talking, stress, and four activities of daily life (ADL). Patients were simultaneously monitored with portable multi-channel accelerometry (four pairs of bi-axial sensors mounted onto the most affected arm, leg, and at the trunk) and recorded by video. LID severity was assessed with a modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (m-AIMS). The signals were analyzed, and every 1/8-second interval the amplitude was obtained of the dominant frequency within 1-4 Hz and 4-8 Hz frequency bands (Amp1-4 and Amp4-8). For both measures, convergent validity, reproducibility, and responsiveness were determined.In absence of voluntary movements, a significant relation was found between Amp1-4 and Amp4-8 and m-AIMS. Repeated measurements during rest showed a high reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90 [Amp1-4] and 0.86[Amp4-8]). The extent to which LID increased with talking and stress correlated significantly (p = 0.02) between the objective and clinical measures (intraclass correlation for differences = 0.67). During ADL, LID occurred in a similar frequency band as voluntary movements and only Amp1-4 and Amp4-8 of the trunk and leg sensor remained highly correlated with m-AIMS.Although objective measures of LID are reliable and responsive, they fail to distinguish LID from voluntary movements. These measures are of value only when obtained during rest (all sensor sites) or during ADL when derived from those body segments that are normally not involved in these ADL tasks (trunk and leg).

If we would exercise regularly, eat healthy, control our weight, sleep enough, manage stress, not smoke and use alcohol only moderately, 90% of type II diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke could be prevented. Health statistics show that lifestyle related diseases are increasing at an alarming rate. Public health promotion campaigns and healthcare together are not effective enough to stop this "tsunami". The solution that is offered is to empower people to manage their health with the assistance of ICT-enabled services. A lot of R&D and engineering effort is being invested in Personal Health Systems. Although some progress has been made, the market for such systems has not yet emerged. The aim of this critical review is to identify the barriers which are holding back the growth of the market. It looks into the theoretical foundations of behavior change support, the maturity of the technologies for behavior change support, and the business context in which behavior change support systems are used.},

But that promise can only be realized if the MICT applications are used by the medical staff. This paper reports on a study examining nurses' decisions to utilize MICTs. A mixed-methods approach is used, consisting of both qualitative and quantitative elements, that reveals and empirically tests the significance of novel constellations of fit (i.e., identification, information, patient interaction, physical, time criticality, user comfort, and workflow fit) and individual characteristics, presented as basic human drives (i.e., drive to acquire, bond, defend, and learn). Findings indicate that fit is a multi-faceted construct and that archetypical human drives have an influence on these various notions, which in turn, impact technology adoption in the healthcare context.},

  Abstract                 = {Obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions in both developing and developed nations. While doctors and caregivers stress the importance of physical exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, many people have difficulty subscribing to a healthy lifestyle. Virtual reality games offer a potentially exciting aid in accelerating and sustaining behavior change. However, care needs to be taken to develop sustainable models of employing games for the management of diabetes and obesity. In this article, we propose an integrative gaming paradigm designed to combine multiple activities involving physical exercises and cognitive skills through a game-based storyline. The persuasive story acts as a motivational binder that enables a user to perform multiple activities such as running, cycling, and problem solving. These activities guide a virtual character through different stages of the game. While performing the activities in the games, users wear sensors that can measure movement (accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers) and sense physiological measures (heart rate, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation). These measures drive the game and are stored and analyzed on a cloud computing platform. A prototype integrative gaming system is described and design considerations are discussed. The system is highly configurable and allows researchers to build games for the system with ease and drive the games with different types of activities. The capabilities of the system allow for engaging and motivating the user in the long term. Clinicians can employ the system to collect clinically relevant data in a seamless manner.},

Foi desenvolvido um prot√≥tipo para discuss√µes e permite que os pesquisadores construam jogos para mensurar os diferentes tipos de atividades. Jogos e realidade virtual , permitem endere√ßar uma oportunidade para o gerenciamento e preven√ß√£o de doen√ßas cr√¥nicas. O gerenciamento da diabetes requer uma grande mudan√ßa de comportamento. Em terceiro lugar os jogos encorajam as mudan√ßas das pr√°ticas nutricionais. N√≥s discutimos previamente e identificamos essas oportunidades ao empregar nos jogos. Os jogos permitem a jovens e adultos a aderirem ao tratamento da diabetes. Goodyear e Kahn exploraram um trabalho sobre a efetividade dos exerc√≠cios f√≠sicos para o tratamento de diab√©ticos (insulinos dependentes ou n√£o) Diversos trabalhos mostram que o exerc√≠cio f√≠sico e o controle de glicose permitem reduzir as maiores complica√ß√µes da doen√ßa. Os pesquisadores rastream a usabilidade do jogo, o grau de entretenimento e a utilidade cl√≠nica do jogo. Os usu√°rios mostram o reflexos de todos esses par√¢metros. O trabalho de Southard demonstram que os jogos podem ser empregados para aumentar a atividade f√≠sica de crian√ßas. Eles desenvolveram um jogo baseado em pedometros e informa√ß√£o nas nuvens chamado de MetaKenKoh. Chen mostrou que os movimentos medidos pelos aceler√¥metros podem prever a energia gasta por pacientes de diabetes. Em um outro estudo Sorenson mostrou que o VO2 max pode ser estimado a partir do monitoramento dos batimentos card√≠acos. sso significa que atrav√©s do monitoramento do batimento card√≠aco √© poss√≠vel estimar a quantidade de energia gasta no jgoo Segundo o autor a id√©ia do integrative gaming system √© linkar as atividades com atividades que fa√ßam medi√ß√£o da glicose, ingest√£o de insulina, executar exerc√≠cios f√≠sicos e condu√ß√£o de resolu√ß√£o de problemas, atrav√©s de uma linha de est√≥ria.

Nesse prot√≥tipo cada exerc√≠cio pode ser visualizado em est√°gios do jogo ligando com as diferentes atividades.

  Abstract                 = {Although a great deal of media attention has been given to the negative effects of playing video games, relatively less attention has been paid to the positive effects of engaging in this activity. Video games in health care provide ample examples of innovative ways to use existing commercial games for health improvement or surgical training. Tailor-made games help patients be more adherent to treatment regimens and train doctors how to manage patients in different clinical situations. In this review, examples in the scientific literature of commercially available and tailor-made games used for education and training with patients and medical students and doctors are summarized. There is a history of using video games with patients from the early days of gaming in the 1980s, and this has evolved into a focus on making tailor-made games for different disease groups, which have been evaluated in scientific trials more recently. Commercial video games have been of interest regarding their impact on surgical skill. More recently, some basic computer games have been developed and evaluated that train doctors in clinical skills. The studies presented in this article represent a body of work outlining positive effects of playing video games in the area of health care.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE.} Suboptimal adherence to self-administered medications is a common problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a video-game intervention for improving adherence and other behavioral outcomes for adolescents and young adults with malignancies including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma. {METHODS.} A randomized trial with baseline and 1- and 3-month assessments was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A total of 375 male and female patients who were 13 to 29 years old, had an initial or relapse diagnosis of a malignancy, and currently undergoing treatment and expected to continue treatment for at least 4 months from baseline assessment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention was a video game that addressed issues of cancer treatment and care for teenagers and young adults. Outcome measures included adherence, self-efficacy, knowledge, control, stress, and quality of life. For patients who were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics, adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was tracked by electronic pill-monitoring devices (n = 200). Adherence to 6-mercaptopurine was assessed through serum metabolite assays (n = 54). {RESULTS.} Adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 6-mercaptopurine was greater in the intervention group. Self-efficacy and knowledge also increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention did not affect self-report measures of adherence, stress, control, or quality of life. {CONCLUSIONS.} The video-game intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for education and training in health care.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND} Ten-year follow-up results from the Parkinson's Disease Research Group of the United Kingdom trial demonstrated that there were no long-term advantages to initiating treatment with bromocriptine compared with l-dopa in early Parkinson disease ({PD).} Increased mortality in patients on selegiline combined with l-dopa led to premature termination of this arm after 6 years. {METHODS} Between 1985 and 1990, 782 patients were recruited into an open pragmatic multicenter trial and were randomized to l-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor ({DDCI)}, l-{dopa/DDCI} plus selegiline, or bromocriptine. The main endpoints were mortality, disability, and motor complications. For final follow-up, health-related quality of life and mental function were also assessed. {RESULTS} Median duration of follow-up at final assessment was 14 years in the 166 (21\%) surviving participants who could be contacted. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, disability scores were better in the l-dopa than in the bromocriptine arm (Webster: 16.6 vs 19.8; p = 0.03; Northwestern University Disability: 34.3 vs 30.0, p = 0.05). Physical functioning (difference 20.8; 95\% {CI} 10.0, 31.6; p {\textless} 0.001) and physical summary scores (difference 5.2; 95\% {CI} 0.7, 9.7; p = 0.03) on the 36-item short-form health survey were also superior on l-dopa. Differences in mortality rates and prevalence of dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, and dementia were not significantly different. {CONCLUSION} Initial treatment with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine did not reduce mortality or motor disability and the initially reduced frequency in motor complications was not sustained. We found no evidence of a long-term benefit or clinically relevant disease-modifying effect with initial dopamine agonist treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {{We developed an algorithm that distinguishes between on and off states in patients with Parkinson's disease during daily life activities. Twenty-three patients were monitored continuously in a home-like situation for approximately 3 hours while they carried out normal daily-life activities. Behavior and comments of patients during the experiment were used to determine the on and off periods by a trained observer. Behavior of the patients was measured using triaxial accelerometers, which were placed at six different positions on the body. Parameters related to hypokinesia (percentage movement), bradykinesia (mean velocity), and tremor (percentage peak frequencies above 4 Hz) were used to distinguish between on and off states. The on-off detection was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity. The performance for each patient was defined as the average of the sensitivity and specificity. The best performance to classify on and off states was obtained by analysis of movements in the frequency domain with a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. We conclude that our algorithm can distinguish between on and off states with a sensitivity and specificity near 0.97. This method, together with our previously published method to detect levodopa-induced dyskinesia, can automatically assess the motor state of Parkinson's disease patients and can operate successfully in unsupervised ambulatory conditions.}},

  Abstract                 = {Almost all patients with Parkinson's disease will eventually require levodopa during the course of their disease. The effectiveness of levodopa is evident, but earlier use and higher doses are causative of the emergence of motor fluctuations. About one half of patients develop motor fluctuations 4-6 years after starting levodopa therapy for parkinsonian symptoms. Peripheral and central pharmacokinetic mechanisms are related to motor fluctuations. It was reported that time to peak concentration (Tmax) and elimination half-life (T(1/2)) of levodopa decreased especially in patients with wearing-off (peripheral pharmacokinetics). On the other hand, there are several reports demonstrating no change in peripheral pharmacokinetics in patients on long-term levodopa therapy. The reduced capacity for presynaptic storage of dopamine by nigral neurons is believed to be another important factor responsible for motor fluctuations (central pharmacokinetics). In addition, a mathematical model that was recently established based on the hypothesis that dopamine release is subject to probabilistic variations in the quantity of dopamine has indicated that motor fluctuations might be explained by presynaptic mechanisms. On the other hand, several studies demonstrated that changes in postsynaptic mechanisms (pharmacodynamics) play an important role in shortening the duration of levodopa action in advanced stages. In clinical practice therapeutic strategies for motor fluctuations are focused on continuous dopaminergic stimulation at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Once motor fluctuations appear, therapeutic regimens should be individualized to retain optimal control of the symptoms based on accurate assessment of each patient's levodopa cycle and responses to drugs. Symptom diaries kept by patients or caregivers are useful for this purpose.},

Due to the nature of the sensing and communication mechanisms, these monitoring sensors are susceptible to errors and failures. In this paper, we address the issue of identifying and isolating faulty sensors in a Body Sensor Network that is used for remote monitoring of daily living activities.

  Abstract                 = {Driven by the confluence between the need to collect data about people‚Äôs physical, physiological, psychological, cognitive, and behavioral processes in spaces ranging from personal to urban and the recent availability of the technologies that enable this data collection, wireless sensor networks for healthcare have emerged in the recent years. In this review, we present some representative applications in the healthcare domain and describe the challenges they introduce to wireless sensor networks due to the required level of trustworthiness and the need to ensure the privacy and security of medical data. These challenges are exacerbated by the resource scarcity that is inherent with wireless sensor network platforms. We outline prototype systems spanning application domains from physiological and activity monitoring to large-scale physiological and behavioral studies and emphasize ongoing research challenges.},

  Review                   = {---- MUITO BOM O ARTIGO - UM SURVEY DA AREA ---- Pontos importantes: Trustworthiness: ------------------------- como √© baseado em redes sensores sem fio que sofrem interfer√™ncia, um ponto importante √© a confiabilidade do dado adquirido pela rede sensor. The impact of obstacles and interference is exacerbated by the fact that most wireless sensor network systems use ow-power radios to achieve long system lifetimes Considering that wireless sensing systems for healthcare will be used by the elderly and medical staff with little training, loss in quality due to operator misuse is a big concern. Privacy and Security ------------------------------- Wireless sensor networks in healthcare are used to determine the activities of daily living (ADL) and provide data for longitudinal studies. The first privacy challenge encountered is the vague specification of privacy. The Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) by the U.S. Government is one attempt to define this term [1]. Fortunately, many solutions with different tradeoffsare possible for this type of physical layer attack. Suchsolutions include 1) attenuating the signal outside of the home to increase the packet loss ratio of the eavesdropper, 2) periodically transmitting radio messages whether or not the device has data to be sent, 3) randomly delaying radio messages to hide the time that the corresponding events occurred, 4) hiding the fingerprint of the transmitter, and 5) transmitting fake data to emulate a real event. By proposing to design a self-healing system with the presence and detection of attacks, rather than trying to build a completely secure system [77] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Medical sensors combine transducers for detecting electrical, thermal, optical, chemical, genetic, and other signals with physiological origin with signal processing algorithms to estimate features indicative of a person‚Äôs health status. Sensors beyond those that directly measure health state have also found use in the practice of medicine. Existem avan√ßos nas tecnologias de monitoramento de pacientes: - Sensing modality: Advances in technologies such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), imaging, and microfluidic and nanofluidic lab-on-chip are leading to new forms of chemical, biological, and genomic sensing and analyses available outside the confines of a laboratory at the point of care. - Size and cost: Most medical sensors have traditionally been too costly and complex to be used outside of clinical environments. However, recent advances in microelectronics and computing have made many forms of medical sensing more widely accessible to individuals at their homes, work places, and other living spaces. ---- futuro : - Finally, we are seeing the emergence of implantable medical sensors for continuously measuring internal health status and physiological signals. In some cases, the purpose is to continuously monitor health parameters that are not externally available, such as intraoccular pressure in glaucoma patients [20]. The goal in other cases is to use the measurements as triggers for physiological interventions that prevent impending adverse events (e.g., epileptic seizures [62]) and for physical assistance (e.g., brain-controlled motor prosthetics [47]). Given their implantable nature, these devices face severe size constraints and need to communicate and receive power wirelessly. Connectivity: Driven by advances in information technology, medical sensors have become increas- ingly interconnected with other devices. Early medical sensors were largely isolated with inte- grated user interfaces for displaying their measure- ments. Subsequently, sensors became capable of interfacing to external devices via wired interfaces such as RS 232, USB, and Ethernet. More recently, medical sensors have incorporated wireless con- nections, both short range, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, and near-field radios to communicate wirelessly to nearby computers, personal digital assistants, or smartphones, and long range, such as WiFi or cellular communications, to communicate directly with cloud computing services. Therefore, such sensors can also record measurements in nonvolatile memory for upload- ing at a later time when they can be shared with healthcare personnel and further analyzed. B. Wireless Sensor Platforms Embedded computing platforms used for healthcare applications range from smartphones to specialized wireless sensing platforms, known as motes, If such a device is active for 1% of the time, its average power consumption is just a few microwatts enabling long-term operation with two AA batteries. Motes are usually equipped with low-power radios such as those compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless sensor networks [33]. III . HE ALTHCARE APPLICATIONS Wirelessly networked sensors enable dense spatio‚Äì temporal sampling of physical, physiological, psychologi- cal, cognitive, and behavioral processes in spaces ranging from personal to buildings to even larger scale ones. In what follows, we introduce a list of healthcare applications enabled by these technologies. - Monitoring in mass-casualty disasters: - Vital sign monitoring in hospitals: - At-home and mobile aging: ========== Wirelessly net- worked sensors embedded in people‚Äôs living spaces or carried on the person can collect information about personal physical, physiological, and behav- ioral states and patterns in real-time and every- where. Such data can also be correlated with social and environmental context. From such Bliving records,[ useful inferences about health and well- being can be drawn. This can be used for self- awareness and individual analysis to assist in making behavior changes, and to share with caregivers for early detection and intervention. At the same time such procedures are effective and economic ways of monitoring age-related illnesses. ====== - Large-scale in-field medical and behavioral studies: Body-worn sensors together with sensor-equipped Internet-connected smartphones have begun to revolutionize medical and public health research studies by enabling behavioral and physiological data to be continually collected from a large num- ber of distributed subjects as they lead their day to day lives. With their ability to provide insight into subject states that cannot be replicated in con- trolled clinical and laboratory settings and that cannot be measured from computer-assisted retro- spective self-report methods, such sensing systems are becoming critical to medical, psychological, and behavioral research. Indeed, a major goal of the exposure biology program under National Institute of Health (NIH) Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI) is to develop such field deployable sensing tools to quantify exposures to environment (e.g., psychosocial stress, addiction, toxicants, diet, phys- ical activity) objectively, automatically, and for days at a time in the participants‚Äô natural environments. Researchers, both within the GEI program (e.g., [35], [45], and [58]) and elsewhere (e.g., [27], [55], and [63]), have also recognized the utility of such sensing in making measurements for longitudinal studies ranging from the scale of individuals to large populations. ---------------- ESSE √â O FOCO PEGAR ESSAS REFERENCIAS: [35], [45], [58][27], [55],[63]), The last critical dimension is the type of wireless networking and sensing technologies that are used: on- body sensors with long-range radios, body-area networks of short-range on-body sensors with a long-range gateway, sensors implanted in-body with wireless communication and power delivery, wireless sensors embedded in assistive devices carried by individuals, wireless sensors embedded in the environment, and sensors embedded in the ubiq- uitous mobile smartphones.

Second, we identify a privacy framework for mobile healthcare and home-care systems. Third, we extract a set of privacy properties intended for use by those who design systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems, linking them back to the privacy principles. Finally, we list several important research questions that the community should address. We hope that the privacy framework in this paper can help to guide the researchers and developers in this community, and that the privacy properties provide a concrete foundation for privacy-sensitive systems and applications for mobile healthcare and home-care systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Parkinson's disease is classified as a chronic movement disorder. The incidence of Parkinson's disease is proportional to age. The status of Parkinson's disease is characterized through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is an ordinal scale, for which the scale is qualitatively evaluated. The inherent issue of the ordinal scale is the lack of a temporal parameter to evaluate the attributes of the movement disorder. The evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale requires clinical specialization, occurring in a clinical environment. Accelerometers, through the advent of miniaturization, have reached a capacity to advance the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Tremor characteristics and temporal attributes of Parkinson's disease can be readily quantified. Accelerometer systems have been tested and evaluated for ascertaining general status, drug therapy efficacy, and amelioration of Parkinson's disease based on deep brain stimulation parameter settings. Further advance of the accelerometer characterization of Parkinson's disease attributes involves the incorporation of a fully wearable system. Such a system is possible with the integration of wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometers. The device proposed incorporates a wireless and potentially wearable {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer mounted on the dorsum of the hand. The wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system can potentially track the Parkinson's disease status through out real time for a subject at the home-based setting of the subject. An implication of the device is a subject database can be generated quantifying the progression of Parkinson's disease. Drug therapy dosage may be optimized with quantified feedback from the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system. Deep brain stimulation parameters may be further refined, and the conceptual foundation for real time deep brain stimulation parameter optimization is established. Enclosed is the initial test and evaluati- - on of the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system through the quantification of simulated tremor.},

However, the performances of SVMs are based on choosing the proper kernel functions or proper parameters of a kernel function. It is extremely time consuming by applying the k-fold cross-validation (CV) to choose the almost best parameter. Nevertheless, the searching range and fineness of the grid method should be determined in advance. In this paper, an automatic method for selecting the parameter of the normalized kernel function is proposed. In the experimental results, it costs very little time than k-fold cross-validation for selecting the parameter by our proposed method. Moreover, the corresponding SVMs can obtain more accurate or at least equal performance than SVMs by applying k-fold cross-validation to determine the parameter.},

(Pouco vai contribuir com o trabalho). -------------------- Nesse cen√°rio, uma pesquisa sendo desenvolvida no escopo do projeto ClinicSpace visa propor componentes para a modelagem do contexto clinico no √¢mbito da computa√ß√£o Ub√≠qua em Sa√∫de e desenvolver uma ferramenta que possibilite ao usu√°rio-final declarar o contexto de sua atividade de forma gr√°fica, permitindo ao sistema de suporte a gera√ß√£o autom√°tica de c√≥digo para o gerenciamento das aplica√ß√µes na arquitetura ClinicSpace [Ferreira et al. 2009]. Um dos desafios da Computa√ß√£o Ciente do Contexto √© interpretar a grande quantidade de informa√ß√£o dispon√≠vel e conseguir determinar a√ß√µes a partir da interpreta√ß√£o dessas informa√ß√µes. O contexto cl√≠nico at√© o momento est√° vinculado √†s entidades m√©dico, paciente, sensor, dispositivo, espa√ßo, atividades ou tarefas, recursos e tempo, informa√ß√µes temporais, atemporais e deduzidas. Levam-se em conta as informa√ß√µes coletadas pelos sensores, informa√ß√µes disponibilizadas pelo sistema eletr√¥nico de sa√∫de (pEHR ‚Äì pervasive Electronic Health Record) e informa√ß√µes deduzidas atrav√©s da composi√ß√£o das duas informa√ß√µes conhecidas. O m√©dico contendo uma atividade ao qual vai executar, interage com o sistema pervasivo atrav√©s de um dispositivo (m√≥vel ou n√£o) em um espa√ßo pervasivo, tal espa√ßo disponibiliza para o dispositivo utilizado recursos (impressoras, rede wireless ...), o espa√ßo pervasivo est√° repleto de sensores, os quais monitoram as entidades existentes no ambiente. Tais sensores contem atuadores, que possibilitam criar filtros para as informa√ß√µes obtidas, vindo assim a disparar a√ß√µes autom√°ticas pr√©-definidas anteriormente. Sensores tamb√©m est√£o vinculados a m√©dico e paciente, pois monitoram suas fun√ß√µes vitais (temperatura, press√£o, batimentos card√≠acos ...). O tempo somente existe quando a atividade que o m√©dico vai realizar √© executada. A concep√ß√£o da ferramenta foi feita atrav√©s da constru√ß√£o de uma aplica√ß√£o desenvolvida em Java, atrav√©s dos componentes visuais Swing. Tal ferramenta utiliza uma interface gr√°fica amig√°vel para usu√°rios que j√° estejam familiarizados com outras ferramentas de gera√ß√£o de c√≥digo UML padr√£o. O projeto Activity-Based Computing [Christensen and Bardram 2007] apresenta uma proposta para utiliza√ß√£o de Computa√ß√£o baseada em Tarefas destinada a Ambientes de Sa√∫de.},

This paper explores the potential for use of an unaugmented commodity technology - the mobile phone - as a health promotion tool. We describe a prototype application that tracks the daily exercise activities of people carrying phones, using fluctuation in signal strength to estimate a user's movement. In a short-term study of the prototype that shared activity information amongst groups of friends, we found that awareness encouraged reflection on, and increased motivation for, daily activity. We describe some of the details of the pilot study, and conclude with our intended plans to develop the system further in order to carry out a longer-term clinical trial},

  Abstract                 = {As we observe society in our days, we can see that people live longer; this means that we have an older population. As we know, elder are more likely to have health issues. The special needs presented by elder are gaining a major concern from all of us. Another tendency of our society is the lack of time that people demonstrate and, as a consequence, the lack of time reflects when families can't take care of their own elders. Many solutions are being presented in order to solve this problem. Some of them are taking advantage of the new technology developments in body sensor network area. In this paper we proposed an architecture of a system called Elder Care. The Elder Care solution has two primary goals: monitoring vital signs, sending alerts to family and specialized help and provide a social network in order to wrap all elder to avoid social isolation.},

  Review                   = {The Elder Care solution has two primary goals: - monitoring vital signs, sending alerts to family and specialized help - provide a social network in order to wrap all elder to avoid social isolation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As an emerging problem, providing a better life for elder people and be able to reduce health costs, many solutions The major importance of solutions to deal with elder people is so extreme that there are innumerous projects in development referred in [16] and [17]: OLDES (Older People's e-services at home), CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisting Living EXperiment) , K4CARE (Knowledge-based HomeCare eServices for an ageing Europe), ALADIN (Ambient Lighting Assistance for an Ageing Population), ENABLE (A wearable system supporting services to enable elderly people to live well, independently and at ease), SHARE-IT (Supported human autonomy for recovery and enhancement of cognitive and motor abilities using information technologies), EASY LINE The solutions mentioned above are focused on the physical well being of the patient, monitoring vital signs. Many elder live alone in their homes, isolated, lonely, with no activities what so ever. Arquitetura Proposta --------------------------------- The proposed architecture is divided in 3 primary modules: local monitoring, control center and virtual leisure room (visible in Figure 1). The local monitoring will be installed at patient‚Äôs home, getting vital signs and sending them to the control center that will be responsible for setting in motion the proper alerts and specialized help as a response to abnormal situations. 3.1. Local Monitoring -------------------------------- Local monitoring, represented in Figure 3, will be installed in elder people‚Äôs home. It will acquire vital signs from body wireless sensor, in a non invasive method, and send the abnormal information and samples of normal information to the control center through a communication network. The vital signs to monitor are: blood pressure, ocular pressure, ECG, fall detection and body fluids. This choice was made after some interviews to doctors and nurses staff that indicated these parameters as the more important to survey in elder people. They emphases fall detection as one of the most important parameters, indicating that a fall can mean that the elder had a breakdown and needs immediate assistance. 3.2 Control Center ---------------------------- The control center, represented in Figure 4, will receive the information from all local monitoring. Additionally to the fact of being an information repository, the control center manages all the alerts; meaning that, it is possible to compare current data with the patient record‚Äôs and check what parameters are abnormal and inform the family as well as activate proper emergency responses. This allows having a personalized response for each case because, besides the incoming alert, the control center has all the medical records and previous alerts of each patient. Comunication --------------------- The communications with National Health System is going to be developed using a standard protocol like HL7, DICOM, HIPAA, CEN/TC 251 (WGIII) - Security, Safety and Quality, ISO TC 215 (WG 4) - Security, IEEE P1157 Medical Data Interchange (MEDIX), IEEE P1073 Medical Information Bus (MIB) [18] [19], according to the country where the solution will be implemented. 3.3. Virtual Leisure Room --------------------------------------- As people are getting older, they have a propensity to isolate themselves at home mostly by physical movement difficulties. As a consequence, they start to feel sad and to be a burden to society by not being able to contribute somehow. The virtual leisure room promotes a social relationship between all elder from Elder Care solution in order to prevent social seclusion (Figure 5). The virtual leisure room is going to be conceived to cover most of elder, including people illiterate and with some motor disabilities but cannot be applied to elder that have degenerative mental illnesses, such as Alzheimer. The virtual leisure room will also offer the opportunity to the users to expose their doubts to doctors, nurses and medical staff. This is a benefit because elder people feel, many times, embarrassment to ask personally some questions to their own doctors. This feature will allow that users pose some questions without having to meet the doctor in person. With Elder Care solution we will be able to maintain elders in their homes, surveying their health and make them useful by interaction in the virtual leisure room. Conclus√£o ---------------- O trabalho foi realizado uma pesquisa qualitativa para a proposta de uma arquitetura: We followed a qualitative research with semi structured interviews in order to obtain the requirements necessary to the proposed architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising costs, mobile Health (mHealth) sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. However, the privacy concerns associated with mHealth sensing are a limiting factor for their widespread adoption. The use of wireless body area networks pose a particular challenge. Although there exist protocols that provide a secure and private communication channel between two devices, the large transmission overhead associated with these protocols limit their application to low-power mHealth sensing devices. We propose an adaptive security model that enables use of privacy-preserving protocols in low-power mHealth sensing by reducing the network overhead in the transmissions, while maintaining the security and privacy properties provided by the protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in information and communication technologies, ICT, are bringing new opportunities in the field of middleware systems oriented to ubiquitous environments and wearable devices used for patient telemonitoring. At a time of such challenges, this paper arises from the need to identify robust technical telemonitoring solutions that are both open and interoperable in home or mobile scenarios. These middleware systems demand standardized solutions to be cost effective and to take advantage of standardized operation and interoperability. Thus, a fundamental challenge is to design a plug-&-play platform that, either as individual elements or as components, can be incorporated in a simple way into different telecare systems, perhaps configuring a personal user network. Moreover, there is an increasing market pressure from companies not traditionally involved in medical markets, asking for a standard for personal health devices (PHD), which foresee a vast demand for telemonitoring, wellness, ambient assisted living (AAL) and applications for ubiquitous-health (u-health). However, the newly emerging situations imply very strict requirements for the protocols involved in the communication. The ISO/IEEE 11073 (X73) family of standards is adapting to new personal devices, implementing high quality sensors, and supporting wireless transport (e.g. Bluetooth) and the access to faster and reliable communication network resources. Its optimized version (X73-PHD) is adequate for this new technology snapshot and might appear the best-positioned international standards to reach this goal. This work presents an updated survey of this standard and its implementation in a middleware telemonitoring platform.},

  Abstract                 = {Lack of exercise is known to be detrimental to health, and various exercise machines that can be used indoors in a convenient manner are available. However, because expertise is required to ascertain which exercise to do and for how long, people sometimes sustain injuries by exercising excessively and find it difficult to sufficiently benefit from exercising. Therefore, fitness machines with automatic controls are being developed so that people can exercise efficiently, and exercise programs are being designed with game elements to encourage regular exercise. Monotonous exercise makes it difficult for people to experience a sense of accomplishment while exercising, and if the degree of difficulty is not set properly, people cannot perform the appropriate amount of exercise. The present study proposes a fitness game method in which heart rate is measured in real time while playing a game and the contents of the game are actively adjusted based on heart rate, thus allowing users to perform sufficient amounts of exercise and experience a sense of accomplishment. A fitness game based on boxercise movements was designed based on the present method and then evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {The face of health care is changing as new technologies are being incorporated into the existing infrastructure. Electronic patient records and sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring are at the current forefront of new technologies. Paper-based patient records are being put in electronic format enabling patients to access their records via the Internet. Remote patient monitoring is becoming more feasible as specialized sensors can be placed inside homes. The combination of these technologies will improve the quality of health care by making it more personalized and reducing costs and medical errors. While there are benefits to technologies, associated privacy and security issues need to be analyzed to make these systems socially acceptable. In this paper we explore the privacy and security implications of these next-generation health care technologies. We describe existing methods for handling issues as well as discussing which issues need further consideration.},

Para essa pesquisa iremos focar somente no monitoramento de pacientes --------------- Trabalhos Correlatos ============== Intel‚Äôs Integrated Digital Hospital (IDH) is aimed at improving health care worldwide by linking people, processes and technologies [17]. The IDH system combines mobile point-of-care (MPOC) and other information technology to integrate patient and administrative information into a comprehensive, digital view of a patient‚Äôs health. The Information Technology for Assisted Living at Home (ITALH) project at University of California, Berkeley is looking at sensor networks for remote patient monitoring [6].This project aims to create a system based on wearable sensors that will allow people who require assistance to live at home to do so using information technology. Kansas State University and the University of Alabama in Huntsville have a combined effort working on Wide Area Body Networks (WABN) Infrastructures [12].They are developing wearable health status monitoring systems that can be used for in home patient monitoring. New sensors are also being developed to do different forms of monitoring. For example, wearable fall detectors that include accelerometers are being developed by ITALH [2]. In most of these systems, a periodic report from the sensors is sent back via wireless communication, using ZigBee, Bluetooth, or other technologies, to a local base station within the home. This local base station, e.g. a personal computer, evaluates the data sent back by the sensors. For example, if data of an abnormality in vital signs appears, the local base station can send the sensor data, along with an alarm, to a central monitoring station. This enables the health care providers at the central monitoring station to take the appropriate steps to aid the patient. The transmission of the information between the home and the monitoring site is done through the Internet. This type of system minimally restricts the patients daily activities, while still allowing him/her to be monitored. =========== These technologies will provide many benefits for health care delivery, yet there are a number of security and privacy implications that must be explored in order to promote and maintain fundamental medical ethical principles and social expectations. =================================== remote sensor networks for patient monitoring ISSUES =================================== A. Data Access and Storage There has long been concern over a patient‚Äôs health record privacy and confidentiality [5]. Connecting personal health information to the Internet exposes this data to more hostile attacks compared to the paper-based medical records. However, once this information is available electronically, it opens the door for hackers and other malicious attackers to access the records as well as those who are authorized. In addition, given the distributed nature of sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring, there is a greater challenge in ensuring data security and integrity compared to the traditional health care system. Eavesdropping and skimming are a possibility when the sensor data is transmitted wirelessly. Data access, storage, and integrity are key challenges when implementing EPRs and in-home sensor networks. The following questions need to be answered: ---------------- 1. Who owns the data? The question of ‚Äôwho owns the data‚Äô is particularly troublesome and unsettled.It has been the object of recurrent, highly- publicized lawsuits and congressional inquiries. Furthermore, some HMOs have been refusing to cover a patient‚Äôs expenses when the patient has participated in clinical treatment protocols that are experimental [3]. It is unclear what level of privacy and security protection must be maintained when data is transferred to a third party. 2. What type of data, and how much data, shouldbe stored? Doctors‚Äô notes, MRIs, and lab test results are examples of data that is stored in patient‚Äôs paper- based record. Regarding EPRs, should all of this data be electronically stored or will a subset of this data be sufficient for health care purposes? For example, data may be aggregated and the results stored, and this may be enough information for the EPR users. 3. Where should the health data be stored? This is a question of centralized versus decentralized storage. In the case of EPRs, should data reside in local databases that can be connected to each other, or should it be stored in a central database? 4. Who can view a patient‚Äôs medical record? We divide the EPR users into two categories: a) users with the read/write privileges - such as the doctors and nurses, who can not only view a patient‚Äôs EPR, but can also edit the records. b) users with read ======================= 5. To whom should this information be disclosed to without the patient‚Äôs consent? ======================= There are situationsin which the patient‚Äôs health information needs to be disclosed to people other than the previously authorized users. For example, in the case of remote patient monitoring, an emergency might necessitate disclosure of health data without the patient‚Äôs consent in order for that patient to receive necessary care. ============================== Solutions ============================== 1. Role-based access control: one of the most challenging problems in managing large networks is the complexity of security administration [16]. 2. Encryption: Encryption can be used to ensure the security of the data and help prevent eavesdropping and skimming. Encryption can be accomplished in hardware as well as in software. 3. Authentication Mechanisms: Authentication mechanisms can be used to ensure the data is coming from the person/entity it is claiming to be from [11]. =========== Future Work =========== Policy development: New policy needs to be created that can deal with across state jurisdiction. While the HIPAA Privacy Rules provide some groundwork, more needs to be done to create clear rules that users can rely upon.},

  Abstract                 = {In a world where competitors are just a mouse-click away, human-centered design (HCD) methods change from a last minute add-on to a vital part of the software development lifecycle. However, case studies indicate that existing process models for HCD are not prepared to cope with the organizational obstacles typically encountered during the introduction and establishment of HCD methods in industrial software development organizations. Knowledge about exactly how to most efficiently and smoothly integrate HCD methods into development processes practiced by software development organizations is still not available. To bridge this gap, we present the experience-based human-centered design lifecycle, an interdisciplinary effort of experts in the fields of software engineering, human-computer interaction, and process improvement. Our approach aims at supporting the introduction, establishment and continuous improvement of HCD processes in software development organizations. The approach comprises a process model, tools, and organizational measures that promote the utilization of HCD methods in otherwise technology-centered development processes and facilitate organizational learning in HCD. We present results of a case study where our approach has been successfully applied in a major industrial software development project.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1993, the last {AAN} Practice Parameter on medical treatment of Parkinson's disease ({PD)} concluded that levodopa was the most effective drug for management of this disorder. Since then, a number of new compounds including non-ergot dopamine agonists ({DA)} and sustained-release levodopa have been released and studied. Thus, the issue of treatment in de novo {PD} patients warrants reexamination. Specific questions include: 1) does selegiline offer neuroprotection; 2) what is the best agent with which to initiate symptomatic treatment in de novo {PD;} and 3) is there a benefit of sustained release levodopa over immediate-release levodopa? Using evidence-based principles, a literature review using {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all human trials in de novo {PD} between 1966 and 1999. Only articles that fulfilled class I or class {II} evidence were included. Based on this review, the authors conclude: 1) Selegiline has very mild symptomatic benefit (level A, class {II} evidence) with no evidence for neuroprotective benefit (level U, class {II} evidence). 2) For {PD} patients requiring initiation of symptomatic therapy, either levodopa or a {DA} can be used (level A, class I and class {II} evidence). Levodopa provides superior motor benefit but is associated with a higher risk of dyskinesia. 3) No evidence was found that initiating treatment with sustained-release levodopa provides an advantage over immediate-release levodopa (level B, class {II} evidence).},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVES‚ÄîTo} measure the rate of progression in striatal [{18F]dopa} metabolism in a large group (n=32) of patients with Parkinson's disease, to estimate the average duration of preclinical period, and to examine the influence of the {PET} method on the assessment of rate of progression and preclinical period.‚Ä®{METHODS‚ÄîThirty} two patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age 58 ({SD} 13) years, mean duration 39 ({SD} 33) months) were assessed with [{18F]dopa} {PET} and {UPDRS} scoring on two occasions a mean of 18 ({SD} 6) months apart. {PET} data were sampled with separate caudate and putamen and total striatal regions of interest, and both graphical (Ki) and ratio methods of analysis.‚Ä®{RESULTS‚ÄîThe} mean annual rate of deterioration in [{18F]dopa} uptake varied according to structure and method of analysis, with putamen Ki showing the most rapid mean rate of progression (4.7\% of normal mean per year). The group showed a significant deterioration (p{\textless}0.0004, paired two tailed t test) in {UPDRS} and in the putamen (p=0.008) and total striatal (p=0.012) [{18F]dopa} uptake measured using a graphical analysis, but no significant change in caudate or putamen uptake measured by a ratio approach. A study of sensitivity confirmed that putamen Ki was the most sensitive measure of disease progression, caudate ratio the least. Symptom onset in Parkinson's disease was estimated at a mean putamen [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 75\% of normal and a mean caudate [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 91\% of normal.‚Ä®{CONCLUSIONS‚ÄîEstimation} of mean rate of progression varies according to the sensitivity of a functional imaging method to clinical severity. Sensitivity and reproducibility of method must be considered when designing studies of disease progression and neuroprotection. The mean preclinical period in Parkinson's disease is unlikely to be longer than seven years.},

  Abstract                 = {Exergaming is expanding as an option for sedentary behavior in childhood/adult obesity and for extra exercise for gamers. This paper presents the development process for a mobile active sports exergame with near-realistic motions through the usage of body-wearable sensors. The process begins by collecting a dataset specifically targeted to mapping real-world activities directly to the games, then, developing the recognition system in a fashion to produce an enjoyable game. The classification algorithm in this paper has precision and recall of 77% and 77% respectively, compared with 40% and 19% precision and recall on current activity monitoring algorithms intended for general daily living activities. Aside from classification, the user experience must be strong enough to be a successful system for adoption. Indeed, fast and intense activities as well as competitive, multiplayer environments make for a successful, enjoyable exergame. This enjoyment is evaluated through a 30 person user study. Multiple aspects of the exergaming user experience trials have been merged into a comprehensive survey, called ExerSurvey. All but one user thought the motions in the game were realistic and difficult to cheat. Ultimately, a game with near-realistic motions was shown to be an enjoyable, active video exergame for any environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Detection of gait characteristics has found considerable interest in fields of biomechanics and rehabilitation sciences. In this paper an approach for abnormal gait detection employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis has been presented. The joint angle characteristics in frequency domain have been analyzed and using the harmonic coefficients, recognition for abnormal gait has been performed. The experimental results and analysis represent that the proposed algorithm based on DFT can not only reduce the gait data dimensionality effectively, but also lightens the computation cost, with a satisfactory distinction. In order to make the algorithm more generic, a mean square error (MSE) analysis is also presented. Future work will be the expansion of the detection introduced in this system to include abnormality detection instead of just an abnormal or normal detection that would prove to be a valuable addition for use in a variety of applications, including unobtrusive clinical gait analysis, automated surveillance etc.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Clinical distinction between advanced essential tremor and tremulous Parkinson's disease can be difficult. METHODS: In selected power spectra of accelerometric postural tremor recordings on the more affected side of 41 patients with essential tremor and 39 patients with tremulous Parkinson's disease being indistinguishable by tremor frequency, peak power or number of harmonic peaks, waveform asymmetry (autocorrelation decay), and mean peak power of all harmonic peaks were computed. Cutoff for essential tremor-Parkinson's disease distinction was determined by receiver operating characteristics. Diagnostic yield was tested in 12 clinically unclear patients with monosymptomatic tremor, subsequently definitively diagnosed with essential tremor (n = 2) or Parkinson's disease (n = 10) by 123-I FP-CIT-single-photon emission computed tomography, fluorodopa-positron emission tomography, or clinical course. RESULTS: By autocorrelation decay 64%, by mean harmonic peak power 94% (Parkinson's disease > essential tremor) of patients with a definite clinical diagnosis, and 11 of 12 clinically unclear patients were classified correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Mean harmonic power is a useful measure to separate clinically difficult cases of advanced essential tremor from tremulous Parkinson's disease. ¬© 2011 Movement Disorder Society. },

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in healthcare applications is gaining momentum through the increasing array of wearable vital sign sensors and location tags which can track both healthcare personnel and patient status/ location continuously in real-time mode. Despite the increased range of potential application frameworks ‚Äî ranging from pre-hospital, in-hospital, ambulatory and home monitoring, to long-term database collection for longitudinal trend analysis ‚Äî the security gap between existing WSN designs and the requirements of medical applications remains unresolved. Generally, WSN devices are extremely limited in terms of power, computation, and communication. They are often deployed in accessible areas, thus increasing security vulnerabilities. The dynamic ad hoc topology, multicast transmission, location awareness, critical data prioritisation, and co-ordination of diverse sensors of healthcare applications further exacerbate the security challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various WSN security mechanisms from the demanding perspective of healthcare applications, and considers the importance of security to the successful deployment of pervasive computing solutions in the healthcare industry.},

O SOS constr√≥i uma Rede Overlay (RO) sobre uma Rede de Sensor Sem Fio (RSSF).Ao estabelecer e monitorar rotas alternativas, o SOS e capaz de encontrar rotas mais seguras que as fornecidas pelo protocolo de roteamento padr ÃÉ o. Os resultados indicam que o SOS e: 1) eficaz no aumento da taxa de entrega de mensagens em redes sob ataques de negacao de servico e 2) eficiente em termos de consumo de energia. At ÃÅ onde sabemos, o SOS e o primeiro mecanismo de seguranca baseado em ROs para RSSFs.},

  Review                   = {Redes overlay (ROs) s ÃÉ o redes constru ÃÅdas sobre redes f ÃÅsicas convencionais, cuja funcao e migrar parte da complexidade de roteamento para a camada de aplicacao [Andersen et al. 2001]. Baseadas em um dado crit ÃÅ rio, ROs s ÃÉ o capazes de monitorar a rede e fornecer caminhos alternativos ao usu ÃÅ rio. Tais caminhos s ÃÉ o constru ÃÅdos atrav ÃÅ s da atuacao de n√≥s overlay como intermedi√°rios no envio de dados. Como qualquer outro tipo de rede ad hoc sem fio, RSSFs s ÃÉ o vulner ÃÅ veis a ataques [Karlof and Wagner 2003, Wood and Stankovic 2002]. Por ÃÅ m, al ÃÅ m das vulnerabili dades j√° existentes na comunicacao sem fio de redes ad hoc em geral, RSSFs enfrentam problemas adicionais. Elas comumente s ÃÉ o dispostas em ambientes abertos, muitas vezes O objetivo deste trabalho e avaliar o emprego de ROs para aumentar a seguranca de RSSFs hier ÃÅ rquicas e heterogÀÜ neas. Mais detalhadamente, ao empregar redes ROs sobre RSSFs, esperamos aumentar a taxa de entrega de mensagens contendo informacao sens√≠vel a ERB em ambientes sob ataques de negacao de servico (Denial of Service ‚ÄìDoS). Trabalhos Relacionados -------------------------------------- Propostas de roteamento seguro para redes ad hoc em geral ( [Zhou and Haas 1999, Pa- padimitratos and Haas 2002, Capkun and Hubaux 2003], por exemplo) n ÃÉ o s ÃÉ o adequa-a a das para RSSFs, pois ou contam com criptografia de chave p ÃÅ blica, ou n ÃÉ o levam em consideracao o roteamento assim ÃÅ trico de ‚Äúmuitos pra um‚Äù de uma RSSF. Staaddon et al., por exemplo, propuseram um algoritmo eficiente para identificar n ÃÅ s que falharam [Staddon et al. 2002] e desviar a informacao para rotas alternativas. Algumas das id ÃÅ ias do trabalho, como a descoberta da vizinhanca por n ÃÅ s e o envio desta e o informacao a ERB, foram tamb ÃÅ m empregadas pelo SOS. J ÃÅ Perrig et al. [Perrig et al. 2002] apresentaram SPINS, um conjunto de protocolos baseados em chaves sim ÃÅ tricas para fornecer primitivas de seguranca (sigilo, autenticacao, integridade etc.) durante o roteamento. H√° tamb√©m trabalhos exclusivamente voltados para RSSFs hier ÃÅ rquicas. Ambos os trabalhos de Kong et al. [Kong et al. 2002] e de Bohge e Trappe [Bohge and Trappe 2003] apresentam solucoes para redes hier ÃÅ rquicas e heterogÀÜ neas. Contudo, eles presumem n ÃÅ s muito poderosos, capazes de executar algoritmos de chave p ÃÅ blica. J√° SecLEACH emprega chaves aleat ÃÅ rias para configurar e a operar a rede de forma autenticada e sigilosa 4. Modelo de Rede ------------------------------- Neste trabalho consideramos redes hier ÃÅ rquicas e heterogÀÜ neas em que os n ÃÅ s s ÃÉ o est ÃÅ ticos. ÃÅ A comunicacao funciona da seguinte forma. Entre filhos e CHs e single-hop, eÃß ÃÉ entre CHs em direcao a ERB multi-hop ‚Äì ou seja, de CHs para CHs at ÃÅ que se alcance a ERB. J ÃÅ a ERB alcanca todos os n ÃÅ s diretamente e a comunicacao ERB em direcao aos n√≥s e single-hop. 5. SOS ---------0 O SOS constr ÃÅ i uma RO sobre uma RSSF da seguinte forma. Alguns ou a totalidade do n√≥s da RSSF subjacente s ÃÉ o escolhidos para integrar a RO. A cada um desses n ÃÅ s, atribu√≠da. Esses vizinhos, chamados de n ÃÅ s overlay, uma lista de vizinhos l ÃÅ gicos lhes e chamados de vizinhos overlay, s ÃÉ o usados como intermedi ÃÅ rios em rotas alternativas a rota fornecida pelo protocolo padr ÃÉ o de roteamento (rota padr ÃÉ o). Os n ÃÅ s overlay ent ÃÉ o alternam igualmente o envio de mensagens n ÃÉ o priorit ÃÅ rias por essas rotas, incluindo a padr√£o.},

The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game designers.},

  Review                   = {Objetivo: This paper presents the results of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using accelerometer data to estimate the severity of symptoms and motor complications in patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks. O termo acinesia refere-se √† redu√ß√£o da quantidade de movimento enquanto que bradicinesia significa lentid√£o na execu√ß√£o do movimento. O paciente apresenta redu√ß√£o da movimenta√ß√£o espont√¢nea em todas as esferas. Introdu√ß√£o ----------------- PARKINSON‚Äôs disease affects about 3% of the population over the age of 65 years and more than 500,000 U.S. residents. The characteristic motor features of the disease include tremor, bradykinesia (i.e., slowness of movement), rigidity (i.e., resistance to externally imposed movements), and impaired postural balance. motivo da doen√ßa ----------------------------- The primary biochemical abnormality in Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a deficiency of dopamine due to degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Tratamento ------------------ Current therapy is based on augmentation or replacement of dopamine, using the biosynthetic precursor levodopa or drugs that activate dopamine receptors [1]. Problemas do Tratamento ----------------------------------------- These therapies are successful for some time, but most patients eventually develop motor complications [2]. Complications include wearing-off, the abrupt loss of efficacy at the end of each dosing interval, and dyskinesias, involuntary and, at times, violent writhing movements. Wearing-off and dysk- inesias produce substantial disability, and frequently interfere with medical therapies [3], [4]. Motiva√ß√£o da Aplica√ß√£o ------------------------------------- Furthermore, variations in the severity of symptoms and motor complications (referred to as ‚Äúmotor fluctuations‚Äù) are observed during dosing intervals. Currently available tools for monitoring motor fluctuations are limited [5], [6]. In clinical practice, information about motor fluctuations is usually obtained by asking patients to recall the number of hours of ON (i.e., when medications effectively attenuate tremor) and OFF time (i.e., when medications are not effective). This kind of self-report is subject to perceptual bias (e.g., patients often have difficulty distinguishing dyskinesia from other symptoms) and recall bias. Another approach is the use of patient diaries, which can improve reliability by recording symptoms as they occur, but does not capture many of the features useful in clinical decision making [7]. Despite recent advances in wearable technology [17] and the development of software that optimizes the use of resources in body sensor networks [18], [19], the use of low-power radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard that has been adopted for implementing the majority of the available body sensor networks is still marked by excessive power consumption thus preventing long-term monitoring of patients unless one implements ad hoc strategies. To decrease power consumption requirements, our research team and others have pursued solutions that minimize the amount of information to be transferred wirelessly from the nodes to the base station of the monitoring system. This goal can be met by extracting (on the body sensor network nodes) and wirelessly transmitting features estimated from the raw data, instead of transmitting the raw data itself. Uma limita√ß√£o dos trabalhos anteriores foi a dificuldade de desenvolver um sistema para monitorar os pacientes com parkinson integrando os algoritmos propostas para estimar a severidade e complica√ß√µes dos sintomas motores de parkinson com a computa√ß√£o vest√≠vel. Outra limita√ß√£o dos trabalhos anteriores foi o foco em sintomas √∫nicos como trmores ou uma complica√ß√£o motoro dyskinesia. O gerenciamento cl√≠nico da doen√ßa de parkinson requer uma complexa intera√ß√£o com os medicamentos dos m√∫ltimpos sintomas, motores e as as complica√ß√µes monitoradas ao longo do tempo, avaliadas e integradas em algoritimos de ger√™nciamento cl√≠nico desses pacientes. COLETA DE DADOS =========== Doze indiv√≠duos foram recrutados e estudados com idades entre 46 a 75 anos, diagnosticados com doen√ßa de Parkinson idiop√°tica. Os sujeitdos ingerem seu primeiro medicamento pela manh√£ quando eles fazem e testam definindo como estado "OFF". Essa abordagem √© usado para observar o paciente durante os sintomas motores mais severos. Os sujeitos s√£o instru√≠dos para avaliar o padr√£o das tarefas motoras utilizados clinicamente para avaliar os pacientes com doen√ßa de parkinson. These motor tasks are part of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale ~\cite{updrs} and included finger-to-nose (reaching and touching a target), finger tapping, repeated hand movements (opening and closing both hands), heel tapping, quiet sitting, and alternating hand movements (repeated pronation/supination movements of the forearms). Fig. 1 shows pictures taken during the execution of these tasks. After completion of the baseline trial, subjects took their medications and were then tested using the same procedure every 30 min. Data was collected during seven trials performed at intervalsof 30 min. Video recordings were made during each trial so that a clinical evaluation of the severity of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia could be performed later on. A clinical expert examined the video recordings and provided clinical scores representing the severity of tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia for each motor task performed by patients during each trial. Such assessment relied upon the Unified Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Rating Scale [20], which provides five discrete levels of severity ranging from 0 to 4. Clinical scores provided by clinicians via visual examination of the video recordings were compared with estimates derived from the accelerometer data using the methods described in the following sections.

  Abstract                 = {{ The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments in the field of wearable sensors and systems that are relevant to the field of rehabilitation. The growing body of work focused on the application of wearable technology to monitor older adults and subjects with chronic conditions in the home and community settings justifies the emphasis of this review paper on summarizing clinical applications of wearable technology currently undergoing assessment rather than describing the development of new wearable sensors and systems. A short description of key enabling technologies (i.e. sensor technology, communication technology, and data analysis techniques) that have allowed researchers to implement wearable systems is followed by a detailed description of major areas of application of wearable technology. Applications described in this review paper include those that focus on health and wellness, safety, home rehabilitation, assessment of treatment efficacy, and early detection of disorders. The integration of wearable and ambient sensors is discussed in the context of achieving home monitoring of older adults and subjects with chronic conditions. Future work required to advance the field toward clinical deployment of wearable sensors and systems is discussed. }},

  Abstract                 = {Extended communication and advanced cooperation in a permanently growing healthcare and welfare domain require a well-defined set of security services provided by an interoperable security infrastructure based on international and European standards. Any communication and collaboration procedure requires a purpose. But such legal purpose-binding is definitely not the only aspect to carefully be observed and investigated. More and more, aspects of security, safety, privacy, ethics, and quality reach importance while discussing about future-proof health information systems and health networks ‚Äì regardless whether local, regional or even pan-European networks. During the course of the current paradigm change from an organization-centered to a process-related and to a person centered health system, different new technologies including mobile solutions need to be applied in order to meet challenges arising from both legal and technical circumstances. Beside the typical Information and Communication Technology systems and applications, the extended use of modern technologies includes large medical devices like, e.g., MRI and CT but also small devices like sensors worn by a person or included in clothing. Security and safety are on top of the priority list. The paper addresses the identification of some specific aspects like mobile technology and safety when moving both IT and people towards mobile health aiming at increasing citizens and patients awareness, confidence, and acceptance in future mobile care - a world often still beyond the horizon.},

  Review                   = {The paper addresses the identification of some specific aspects like mobile technology and safety when moving both IT and people towards mobile health aiming at increasing citizens and patients awareness, confidence, and acceptance in future mobile care - a world often still beyond the horizon. Advanced information and communication technology (ICT) solutions are an important pre-requisite for establishing today‚Äôs integrated care solutions. Disease management programs (DMP), public health and surveillance systems, and personal care settings are other aspects to be addressed in this context. 2.3. Applied Security Requirements Secure and reliable communication in a mobile world has applied security require- ments coming from different viewpoints. The first one is the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù security domain. Mobile communications address both communication and application security services. 2.4. Technical Security Approaches Mobile communication requires the same -or at least a similar- level of security as ordinary communication using typical infrastructures like LAN or MAN. Thus, mobile security solutions can be based on well-known and well-established symmetric (DES, 3DES, IDEA, AES) and asymmetric (RSA) cryptographic algorithms as well as key traditional exchange protocols, e.g., following the Diffie-Hellman approach [8]. 3. RFID and NFC as a new Chance and Challenge Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) are technical solutions to be applied in healthcare and welfare. Information systems com- bine ordinary information services with the use of RFID for identifying either goods (drugs, tools, tissues, samples) or even persons (health professionals, patients). Data is exchanged between passive RFID tag and readers in a few centimeters range. The ubiquitous presence of electromagnetic fields (EMF) is often expected to cause effects of electric or thermic nature to biological systems. In reality, RFID-related EMF values have a considerably low influence on humans. Side effect, however, can appear and shall specifically be considered when pace makers, brain stimulators or other implants are applied.},

  Abstract                 = {Communication and co-operation processes in the healthcare and welfare domain require a security infrastructure based on services describing status and relation of communicating principals as well as corresponding keys and attributes. Additional services provide trustworthy information on dynamic issues of communication and co-operation such as time and location of processes, workflow relations, integrity of archives and record systems, and system behaviour. To provide this communication and co-operation in a shared care environment, smart cards are widely used. Serving as storage media and portable application systems, patient data cards enable patient-controlled exchange and use of personal health data bound to specific purposes such as prescription and disease management. Additionally, patient status data such as the emergency data set or immunization may be stored in, and communicated by, patient data cards. Another deployment field of smart cards is their token functionality within a security framework, supporting basic security services such as identification, authentication, integrity, confidentiality, or accountability using cryptographic algorithms. In that context, keys, certificates, and card holder's attributes might be stored in the card as well. As an example, the German activity of introducing patient health cards and health professional cards is presented. Specification and enrolment aspects are on-going processes.},

Trata-se de um ensaio cl√≠nico cego e randomizado realizado na Associa√ß√£o Brasil Parkinson e no Centro de Doc√™ncia e Pesquisa dos Cursos de Fonoaudiologia, Fisioterapia e Terapia Ocupacional da Universidade de S√£o Paulo. Participaram do estudo 32 pacientes com doen√ßa de Parkinson nos est√°gios 1 a 2,5 da escala Hoehn e Yahr. Os pacientes foram randomizados nos grupos controle e experimental, 16 em cada grupo. Ambos os grupos realizaram 14 sess√µes individuais de treinamento, duas vezes por semana, por sete semanas. Cada sess√£o foi composta por 30 minutos de exerc√≠cios globais, incluindo alongamento e fortalecimento musculares e mobilidade axial. Logo ap√≥s, ambos os grupos realizaram mais 30 minutos de treinamento de equil√≠brio: o treinamento do grupo controle foi realizado por meio de exerc√≠cios de equil√≠brio sem a utiliza√ß√£o de pistas externas, retroalimenta√ß√£o visual ou auditiva ou estimula√ß√£o cognitiva associada; o grupo experimental realizou o treinamento de equil√≠brio por meio de 10 jogos do Nintendo Wii Fit, os quais estimularam as fun√ß√µes motoras e cognitivas. As principais medidas do estudo foram (1) se√ß√£o {II} da Escala Unificada da Doen√ßa de Parkinson, ({UPDRS);} (2) Escala de Equil√≠brio de Berg ({EEB);} (3) Unipedal Stance Test ({UST)} e (4) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ({MoCA).} A an√°lise estat√≠stica foi realizada por meio da {ANOVA} de medidas repetidas e o p√≥s hoc teste de Tukey para a verifica√ß√£o de poss√≠veis diferen√ßas entre os grupos e avalia√ß√µes realizadas antes, depois e ap√≥s 60 dias do final do treinamento.

  Abstract                 = {Context Video games represent a multibillion-dollar industry in the U.S. Although video gaming has been associated with many negative health consequences, it also may be useful for therapeutic purposes. The goal of this study was to determine whether video games may be useful in improving health outcomes. Evidence acquisition Literature searches were performed in February 2010 in six databases: the Center on Media and Child Health Database of Research, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists were hand-searched to identify additional studies. Only \{RCTs\} that tested the effect of video games on a positive, clinically relevant health consequence were included. Study selection criteria were strictly defined and applied by two researchers working independently. Study background information (e.g., location, funding source); sample data (e.g., number of study participants, demographics); intervention and control details; outcomes data; and quality measures were abstracted independently by two researchers. Evidence synthesis Of 1452 articles retrieved using the current search strategy, 38 met all criteria for inclusion. Eligible studies used video games to provide physical therapy, psychological therapy, improved disease self-management, health education, distraction from discomfort, increased physical activity, and skills training for clinicians. Among the 38 studies, a total of 195 health outcomes were examined. Video games improved 69% of psychological therapy outcomes, 59% of physical therapy outcomes, 50% of physical activity outcomes, 46% of clinician skills outcomes, 42% of health education outcomes, 42% of pain distraction outcomes, and 37% of disease self-management outcomes. Study quality was generally poor; for example, two thirds (66%) of studies had follow-up periods of &lt;12 weeks, and only 11% of studies blinded researchers. Conclusions There is potential promise for video games to improve health outcomes, particularly in the areas of psychological therapy and physical therapy. \{RCTs\} with appropriate rigor will help build evidence in this emerging area.},

The kinematic data is obtained from some clinically suggested therapy modules that are used to monitor quality of improvement of a disabled child, which includes exercises involving the affected joints and muscles. The proposed environment uses the 3D depth sensing Microsoft Kinect device to detect, recognize and track the movement of different key joints of the body and deduce kinematic data from these movements. The method is non-invasive as the child does not need to wear any external devices in the body. The proposed environment incorporates Second Life serious game environment where the live therapeutic movement of child, therapist and one's community of interest is synchronized between physical and virtual world. Finally, we share our preliminary test data, which is validated by the therapists from three different disability hospitals that treat children with Hemiplegia.},

The increasing feasibility and convenience of mobile healthcare has already introduced several significant challenges for healthcare providers, policy makers, hospitals, and patients. A major challenge is to provide round-the-clock healthcare services to those patients who require it via wearable wireless medical devices. Furthermore, many patients have privacy concerns when it comes to releasing their personal information over open wireless channels. As a consequence, one of the most important and challenging issues that healthcare providers must deal with is how to secure the personal information of patients and to eliminate their privacy concerns. In this article we present several techniques that can be used to monitor patients effectively and enhance the functionality of telemedicine systems, and discuss how current secure strategies can impede the attacks faced by wireless communications in healthcare systems and improve the security of mobile healthcare.},

  Abstract                 = {Many healthcare technology projects fail due to the lack of consideration of human issues, such as workflow, organizational change, and usability, during the design and implementation stages of a project's development process. Even when human issues are considered, the consideration is typically on designing better user interfaces. We argue that human-centered computing goes beyond a better user interface: it should include considerations of users, functions and tasks that are fundamental to human-centered computing. From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Life-cycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management. We demonstrated the value provided by our human-centered approach and described the unique properties, structures, and processes discovered using this methodology and how they contributed in the design of the prototype.},

  Abstract                 = {This multicentre randomised double-blind 3- to 5-year trial was designed to assess whether initial therapy with cabergoline alone or in combination with levodopa prevents or delays the occurrence of long term motor complications in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Patients eligible for study inclusion (n = 412) had early idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 to 3) and had received no previous treatment with levodopa, selegiline or dopamine agonists. Patients were randomised to receive either cabergoline (0.25 to 4 mg once daily) or levodopa (100 to 600 mg/day) titrated over a maximum period of 24 weeks. Once the optimum or maximum tolerated dose was achieved, it was maintained up to the end-point (development of motor complications confirmed at 2 consecutive 3-month visits) or up to a minimum of 3 years' treatment. Open labelled levodopa was added in both treatment arms when the improvement in motor disability [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS)} factor {III]} decreased below 30\% vs baseline. Both treatments improved motor disability, decreasing {UPDRS} factor {III} scores and factor {II} scores for activities of daily living. The development of motor complications (end-point) was significantly less frequent in patients treated with cabergoline than in levodopa recipients (22\% vs 34\%; p {\textless} 0.02). The relative risk of developing motor complications during treatment with cabergoline was more than 50\% lower than with levodopa. Serious adverse events, either drug related or not, were slightly more frequent in cabergoline-treated patients (31\%) than in those treated with levodopa (25\%). The withdrawal rate in the cabergoline vs levodopa group was 16 vs 13\%. In conclusion, the study shows that, in patients with early Parkinson's disease, cabergoline is effective either as monotherapy or combined with levodopa. Moreover, starting treatment with cabergoline significantly delays the development of motor complications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A new paradigm for medical care is emerging which terms itself ‚Äúpersonalized medicine‚Äù. Advocates claim that medical treatment can now be targeted on the specific characteristics of each individual, using genetic profiling to identify the particular nature of the condition, and to tailor treatments for each person. Further, they argue, the focus of medicine will move from treatment to prevention. It is claimed that genetic tests based on recent genomic research will enable doctors to identify susceptibilities for such common conditions before the onset of illness, and to target preventive intervention to reduce the individual and social burdens of ill health. Further, it is argued that genetic information will allow precision in the choice of drugs and doses, avoiding adverse reactions, minimising waste, reducing costs and increasing efficacy. Coupled with other advances, it is argued that the future of medicine should and will be ‚Äúpersonalised, predictive and preventive.‚Äù Drawing on such developments, we have seen the growth of personal genomics companies marketing tests ‚Äúdirect to consumers‚Äù that claim to identify individual disease susceptibilities and to ‚Äúempower‚Äù individuals by giving them the information‚Äîand the personal responsibility‚Äîto manage their own health. This paper critically assesses the promises made for personalized medicine, discusses some of the challenges for health policy, and considers the social and ethical implications of moving medical care towards such a personalized and individualized model. },

  Abstract                 = {Privacy issues commonly discussed among researchers, practitioners, and end-users in pervasive healthcare. Pervasive healthcare systems are applications that can support patient‚Äôs need anytime and anywhere. However, pervasive healthcare raises privacy concerns since it can lead to situations where patients may not be aware that their private information is being shared and becomes vulnerable to threat. We have systematically analyzed the privacy issues and present a summary in tabular form to show the relationship among the issues. The six issues identified are medical information misuse, prescription leakage, medical information eavesdropping, social implications for the patient, patient difficulties in managing privacy settings, and lack of support in designing privacy-sensitive applications. We narrow down he issues and chose to focus on the issue of ‚Äòlack of support in designing privacy- sensitive applications‚Äô by proposing a privacy-sensitive architecture specifically designed for pervasive healthcare monitoring systems.},

  Review                   = {Privacy issues commonly discussed among researchers, practitioners, and end-users in pervasive healthcare. This means, for instance, that a patient with heart problems can stay in the comfort of their own home while being monitored by healthcare services, instead of staying at the hospital. that there is a need to address privacy in a pervasive healthcare system. Privacy law generally defines an individual‚Äôs privacy as personal information about an individual that can represent that individual as a whole, which consequently describes an individual. To protect their privacy, patients have the right to give permission as to which data should be collected, used or disclosed [2]. Motivations ------------------ 1. many privacy issues and challenges arise; for that reason, we would like to understand the current issues and challenges. We selected published research papers that relate to ubiquitous computing, pervasive healthcare in general and pervasive healthcare monitoring systems. In 2006 and 2007 there are at least ten published research papers each year. The number of papers published related to these issues increased since 2006 compared to the years 2000 to 2005. This shows that the number of researchers that are interested in this field is increasing. Furthermore this shows that security and privacy issues are important to ensuring the success of pervasive healthcare development and implementation. Healthcare Monitoring System ----------------------------------------------- to ensure help issent immediately in case of emergency. The system can monitor a cancer patient‚Äôs progress from home after treatment or it can monitor a schizophrenic patient‚Äôs behavior at a psychiatric ward. This type of monitoring is important to ensure a patient‚Äôs treatment is accurately recorded hence making it easier for healthcare professionals to provide follow up treatment. If the patient has a problem in future, all the stored data can be easily accessed to speed up the treatment decision. The signal is sent from the device to healthcare providers via Bluetooth connection. If any unusual vital signs are detected, help is immediately sent. The wireless connection could open more privacy issues as it has the potential security flaw of permitting unauthorized persons to steal the data hence intruding patient‚Äôs privacy data. To protect the patient‚Äôs privacy, the system should have strong privacy data management controls to lessen the privacy risk. There are three main stakeholders that have privacy concerns in a healthcare monitoring system: the patient, the family and the healthcare providers. The system is also connected to the mother‚Äôs healthcare providers but they are not allowed to watch the video except in case of emergency. In order to protect the patient‚Äôs data privacy, the healthcare provider also does not have any access to the patient‚Äôs information unless there is an emergency. Privacy Issues --------------------- Privacy issues derive from multidisciplinary fields such as computer science, bioinformatics, the social sciences and medical science. and researchers are also starting to raise privacy issues. For example, before dementia patients agree to use the application, they and their relatives often ask about the privacy policies. This is because they want to ensure that their use either health is taken care of by the healthcare service providers while the privacy of their life is insured. The six issues identified are medical information misuse, prescription leakage, medical information eavesdropping, social implications for the patient, patient difficulties in managing privacy settings, and lack of support in designing privacy-sensitive applications. A. Misuse of Patient Medical Information by Unauthorized Individual B. Prescription Leakage C. Eavesdropping of Patient‚Äôs Medical Information D. Social Implications for the Patients E. Difficulties in Managing Privacy Policies F. Lack of Support in Designing Privacy Sensitive Applications Trabalho Proposto ----------------------------- We have analyzed the privacy issues in ubiquitous computing in general and pervasive healthcare monitoring systems in particular in the previous section. In this section, we propose privacy architecture to enable the development of pervasive healthcare monitoring systems with a better privacy setting. They mention that they want to address issues about patients‚Äô private information leakage by building a healthcare framework that will provide intelligent medical data acquisition. However, it does not mention how patients can manage their privacy settings on their own.},

  Abstract                 = {A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a collection of low-power and lightweight wireless sensor nodes that are used to monitor the human body functions and the surrounding environment. It supports a number of innovative and interesting applications, including ubiquitous healthcare and Consumer Electronics (CE) applications. Since WBAN nodes are used to collect sensitive (life-critical) information and may operate in hostile environments, they require strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the system. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in WBAN at Physical, Medium Access Control (MAC), Network, and Transport layers. Then we discuss the IEEE 802.15.4 security framework and identify the security vulnerabilities and major attacks in the context of WBAN. Different types of attacks on the Contention Access Period (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP) parts of the superframe are analyzed and discussed. It is observed that a smart attacker can successfully corrupt an increasing number of GTS slots in the CFP period and can considerably affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in WBAN (since most of the data is carried in CFP period). As we increase the number of smart attackers the corrupted GTS slots are eventually increased, which prevents the legitimate nodes to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. This means that the direct adaptation of IEEE 802.15.4 security framework for WBAN is not totally secure for certain WBAN applications. New solutions are required to integrate high level security in WBAN.},

  Abstract                 = {The main problem in pervasive healthcare monitoring systems is protection of patient privacy without compromising their safety. Current solutions have two main limitations: (1) they require an extensive exchange of messages among patient's caregivers and devices in order to protect data, and (2) they depend on using data decryption keys that must be provided to specific caregivers. The second limitation compromises safety of patients who need urgent help while their ad hoc caregivers have no access to their health data (since they have no needed decryption keys). This paper proposes an approach for protecting privacy of patients based on active bundles. An active bundle encapsulates sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine. In healthcare monitoring systems, "sensitive data" are monitored health data. To avoid compromising of safety of patients who need urgent help, our approach does not depend on the use of decryption keys provided to specific caregivers (which is a commonly used approach). Instead, it combines the use of privacy policies and protection mechanisms included within active bundles, such as evaporation and apoptosis. In our approach, ad hoc caregivers are able to access urgently needed patients' data. Their authorizations are provided via privacy policies encapsulated in metadata of an active bundle including health data.},

  Abstract                 = {Overweight and obesity has doubled among children in Australia. There is an urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies to prevent current and future unhealthy weight gain. The aims of this paper are to describe a randomized controlled trial ({‚ÄòSwitch-Play‚Äô)} developed to prevent unhealthy weight gain among 10-year-old children and to report the findings of the process evaluation. Children from three government primary schools were randomized by class to one of four conditions: a behavioural modification group ({BM;} n = 69); a fundamental motor skills group ({FMS;} n = 73); a combined {BM} and {FMS} group (n = 90); or a control (usual classroom lessons) group (n = 61). Children in the {BM} group participated in 19 sessions that encouraged them to reduce screen-based behaviours, and identified physical activity alternatives. The {FMS} group participated in 19 lessons that focused on mastery of six skills: run, throw, dodge, strike, vertical jump and kick. The combined group participated in all the {BM} and {FMS} activities. The intervention specialist teacher reported that the children showed high enjoyment and engagement (88\% lessons attended) in most aspects of the programme. At-home tasks were completed by 57‚Äì62\% of the children, and 92\% completed the in-class tasks. Two-thirds of the children in the {BM} group participated in the behavioural contracting to switch off the {TV.} Most of the children reported high enjoyment of the programmes, and only a small proportion (7‚Äì17\%) reported difficulties in switching off their nominated {TV} shows. More than half the children reported reducing their {TV} viewing; however, less than half reported increasing their physical activity. It was found that most aspects of the intervention arms of the programme were successfully delivered to the majority of children participating in {‚ÄòSwitch-Play‚Äô;} that the programmes were delivered as intended; and that the programmes were favourably evaluated by participating children and their parents.},

  Abstract                 = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that predominantly alter patients' motor performance and compromises the speed, the automaticity and fluidity of natural movements. The patients fluctuate between periods in which they can move almost normally for some hours (ON state) and periods with motor disorders (OFF state). Gait properties are affected by the motor state of a patient: reduced stride length, reduced gait speed, increased stride width etc. The ability to assess the motor states (ON/OFF) on a continuous basis for long time without disturbing the patients' daily life activities is an important component of PD management. An accurate report of motor states could allow clinics to adjust the medication regimen to avoid OFF periods. The real-time monitoring will also allow an online treatment by combining, for instance, with automatic drug-administration pump doses. Many studies have attempted to extract gait properties through a belt-worn single tri-axial accelerometer. In this paper, a user friendly position is proposed to place the accelerometer and three step detection methods and three step length estimators are compared considering the proposed sensor placement in signals obtained from healthy volunteers and PD patients. Adaptation methods to these step length estimators are also proposed and compared. The comparison shows that the adapted estimators improve the performance with the new proposed step detection method and reduce errors in respect of the original methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are used in the ubiquitous healthcare to measure human body functions like vital physiological data (e.g. heart beat). As the privacy-sensitive sensor data are transferred over the unreliable wireless connection and can be shared among various BSN applications, it is necessary to protect this data against potential threats. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an approach to design a lightweight security model with respect to limited resource constraints of our special purpose sensor platform.},

  Review                   = {O projeto VITRUVIUS, pretende desenvolver uma plataforma de sensor para o corpo humano, que poassa ser aplicado a diversas redes BSN instaladas dinamicamente, pretendendo se conectar a sistemas de retaguarda de qualquer plataforma. Os dados capturados peos sensores devem ser trafegados por redes sem fio de acordo com os padr√µes de seguran√ßa estabelecidos sem altera√ß√£o ou viola√ß√£o da autenticidade dos dados. Os requisitos de seguran√ßa de uma BSN s√£o significativamente diferentes de uma rede sensor t√≠pica. Contrastando que numa rede sensor t√≠pica s√£o medidos dados p√∫blicos como temperatura, humidade em uma rede BSN s√£o coletados informa√ß√£o vitais humanas como o batimento card√≠aco e a press√£o sangu√≠nea. In this paper we present system architecture and we outline potential threats to the BSN as part of the overall system. With respect to the threats, we define a set of security requirements and summarize related solutions proposed by state-of-the-art security protocols in the WSN. In this paper, we consider threats to the BSN with respect to the communication channel from sensors to body hub. The threats are instantiated by the attacks which are effective because of associated vulnerabilities (weaknesses) in the BSN. Foram examinados a ocorr√™ncia dos seguintes ataques e vulnerabilidades: 1-Wrong data from sensor : This might happen because of a faulty sensor, a noisy channel or malicious alteration of transmitted messages. 2-Data loss 3-Spoofing of sensor : Unintentionally or maliciously a sensor may be attached to a wrong person or a wrong sensor-body hub relationship may be established. Furthermore, the attacker may spoof the identity of the sensor. Our security method must make such spoofing impossible by using authentication. 4-Eavesdropping and replay: A malicious attacker might intercept messages for inspection or replay. Our security method, therefore, must encrypt messages and protect them against the replay III. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS A. Confidentiality. - Uso de criptografia B. Authenticity. - Armazenar o MacAddress + a criptografia C. Replay protection. - Contagem de mensagem e timestamp D. Tolerance to message loss. - O n√∫mero de mensagem perdida pode ser realizada atrav√©s de um contador},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate diagnosis and individualized assessment of the risks and benefits of available antiparkinsonian medications should guide initiation of treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease ({PD).} In general, the goals of treatment for younger patients (less than age 60 years) are control of impairing symptoms, sparing of levodopa to minimize long-term complications, and consideration of neuroprotection. The primary initial medication choices for patients under age 50 years include selegiline, amantadine, and anticholinergic agents. Patients in their fifties may require a dopamine agonist in addition to or instead of selegiline to achieve adequate symptom control. If the desired response is still not achieved, sustained-release carbidopa-levodopa should be added, followed by adjunctive amantadine or anticholinergic therapy. For older patients (60 years and over), improvement of functional impairment is the primary goal. For these patients, a special concern is to avoid inducing or exacerbating cognitive impairment. Sustained-release carbidopa-levodopa is considered first-line treatment for these patients. Inadequate response can be handled by a trial of immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa and then addition of a dopamine agonist when maximum levodopa doses are reached. Anticholinergic agents, amantadine, and selegiline should be avoided because of their {CNS} effects.},

Para remover a necessidade de testes f√≠sicos foi proposto um sistema de extra√ß√£o de dados virtuais. O jogador humano n√£o prov√ä as a√ß√µes diretamente para o controlador do exergame mas sim um controlador de jogo padr√£o para jogar o exergame. A sa√≠da do controlador padr√£o √© ent√£o passado para um controlador virtual que simula o dispositivo de controlo que seria normalmente usado. Como o jogador j√° n√£o realiza a f√≠sica actividades normalmente associadas com o jogo jogar, devemos substituir os biossensores que o jogo usos com um software que gera o sensor simulado de dados. A Figura 2 mostra um jogador emulador estado f√≠sico, que calcula o jogador √© normalmente esperado estado com base no simulado do jogador a√ß√µes f√≠sicas. Os biossensores virtuais, em seguida, usar estado f√≠sico do jogador para gerar o requerido dados de sensores simulados. Emulating the Player‚Äôs Physical State ============================= The physical exertion data generated by the gameplay moves to another part of the system to produce simulated physiological effects on a virtual body. The software developer needs this data to verify that any changes he or she made are on the correct track. The data can be used to make the system work with exergaming systems requiring biofeedback. For example, the software could calculate heart rate such that it can provide input into systems measuring heart rate. Ideally, the virtual body would also be able to respond to excessive exercise in the same manner that a player actually exercising would. =================== Esse trabalho lembra bastante o AVATAR que eu tinha pensado inicialmente que o avatar seria sensivel ao contexto},

There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative.

We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

  Abstract                 = {Current clinical methods for the assessment of Parkinson's disease ({PD)} suffer from inconvenience, infrequency, and subjectivity. {WiiPD} is an approach for the objective home-based assessment of {PD} which utilizes the intuitive and sensor-rich Nintendo Wii remote. Combined with an electronic patient diary, a suite of minigames, a metric analyzer, and a visualization engine, we propose that this system can complement existing clinical practice by providing objective metrics gathered frequently over extended periods of time. In this paper, we detail the approach and introduce a series of metrics deemed capable of quantifying the severity of tremor and bradykinesia in those with {PD.} The system has been tested on a 71-year-old participant with {PD} over a period of 15 days, a 72-year-old control user without {PD}, and a group of eight young adults. Results indicate a clear correlation between patient self-rating scores of tremor severity and metric values obtained, in addition to clear differences in metrics obtained from each user group. These results suggest that this approach is capable of indicating the presence and severity of the motor symptoms of {PD} that affect arm motor control.},

  Abstract                 = {Current clinical methods for the assessment of Parkinson's disease ({PD)} suffer from inconvenience, infrequency, and subjectivity. {WiiPD} is an approach for the objective home-based assessment of {PD} which utilizes the intuitive and sensor-rich Nintendo Wii remote. Combined with an electronic patient diary, a suite of minigames, a metric analyzer, and a visualization engine, we propose that this system can complement existing clinical practice by providing objective metrics gathered frequently over extended periods of time. In this paper, we detail the approach and introduce a series of metrics deemed capable of quantifying the severity of tremor and bradykinesia in those with {PD.} The system has been tested on a 71-year-old participant with {PD} over a period of 15 days, a 72-year-old control user without {PD}, and a group of eight young adults. Results indicate a clear correlation between patient self-rating scores of tremor severity and metric values obtained, in addition to clear differences in metrics obtained from each user group. These results suggest that this approach is capable of indicating the presence and severity of the motor symptoms of {PD} that affect arm motor control.},

Code artifacts are mapped to features, and a customized software system can be generated given a selection of features. The set of software systems that can be generated is called a software product line (SPL). FeatureIDE supports several \{FOSD\} implementation techniques such as feature-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, delta-oriented programming, and preprocessors. All phases of \{FOSD\} are supported in FeatureIDE, namely domain analysis, requirements analysis, domain implementation, and software generation. },

Our starting point has been to understand patients' experiences of becoming ill through a series of focus groups with health professionals, patients and their carers. We used the metaphor of illness as a journey to capture those experiences. We have also reviewed data in the public domain (http://www.healthtalkonline.org). We have employed a theoretical framework which combines concepts from Activity Theory and other social sciences approaches to model illnesses. We outlined a set of design concepts for the design of the SMART 2 system which are emerging from our analysis of the patient experience.},

  Abstract                 = {The seamless integration of low-power, miniaturised, invasive/non-invasive lightweight sensor nodes have contributed to the development of a proactive and unobtrusive Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). A WBAN provides long-term health monitoring of a patient without any constraint on his/her normal dailylife activities. This monitoring requires low-power operation of invasive/non-invasive sensor nodes. In other words, a power-efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is required to satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements including low-power consumption. In this paper, we first outline the WBAN requirements that are important for the design of a low-power MAC protocol. Then we study low-power MAC protocols proposed/investigated for WBAN with emphasis on their strengths and weaknesses. We also review different power-efficient mechanisms for WBAN. In addition, useful suggestions are given to help the MAC designers to develop a low-power MAC protocol that will satisfy the stringent WBAN requirements.},

  Review                   = {A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) allows the integration of intelligent, miniaturized, low- power, invasive/non-invasive sensor nodes in/around a human body that are used to monitor body functions and the surrounding environment. can be a part of diagnostic procedure, maintenance of a chronic condition, supervised recovery from a surgical procedure, and can handle emergency events. Objetivos de uma WBAN Some of the common objectives in WBAN are to achieve maximum throughput, minimum delay, and to maximize the network lifetime by controlling the main sources of energy waste, i.e., collision, idle listening, overhearing, and control packet overhead. Responsabilidade de um MAC A minimal number of control packets should be used for data transmission. Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols play an important role in solving the aforementioned problems. Generally they are grouped into contention-based and schedule-based MAC protocols. In contention-based MAC protocols such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols, nodes contend for the channel to transmit data. The development of a low-power MAC protocol for WBAN has been a hot research topic for the last few years. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to propose/investigate new MAC protocols that could satisfy the crucial WBAN requirements. A number of researchers have considered IEEE 802.15.4 [1] for WBAN since it supports low data rate applications, but it is not enough to support high data rate applications (data rate > 250 Kbps). WBAN MAC REQUIREMENTS ================= 1. The most important attribute of a good MAC protocol for WBAN is energy efficiency. For example, cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers should have a lifetime of more than 5 years, while swallowable camera pills have a lifetime of 12 hours [6]. Power-efficient and flexible duty cycling techniques are required to minimize the idle listening, overhear- ing, packet collisions and control packet overhead problems. 2. The Quality of Service (QoS) is also an important factor of a good MAC protocol for WBAN. For emergency applications, the MAC protocol should allow in-body or on-body nodes to get quick access to the channel (in less than one second) and to send the emergency data to the coordinator. EXISTING / PROPOSED MAC PROTOCOLS FOR WBAN =============================== 1. IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power standard designed for low data rate applications. It offers three operational frequency bands: 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz bands. There are 27 sub-channels allocated in IEEE 802.15.4, i.e., 16 sub-channels in 2.4 GHz band, 10 sub-channels in 915 MHz band and one sub-channel in the 868 MHz band, as given in Some of the main reasons of selecting IEEE 802.15.4 for WBAN are low-power communication and support of low data rate WBAN applications. Nicolas et al. investigated the performance of a non-beacon IEEE 802.15.4 in [10], where low upload/download rates (mostly per hour) are considered. 2. Heartbeat Driven MAC (H-MAC) Protocol A Heartbeat Driven MAC protocol (H-MAC) is a TDMA-based protocol originally proposed for a star topology WBAN. The energy efficiency is improved by exploiting heartbeat rhythm information in order to synchronize the nodes. The nodes do not need to receive periodic information to perform synchronization. The heartbeat rhythm can be extracted from the sensory data and hence all the rhythms represented by peak sequences are naturally synchronized. The H-MAC protocol assigns dedicated time slots to each node to guarantee collision-free transmission. This protocol is supported by an active synchronization recovery scheme supported by two resynchronization schemes. For example, a blood pressure node may not need a dedicated time slot while an endoscope pill may require a number of dedicated time slots when deployed in WBAN. But the slots should be released when the endoscope pill is expelled. The heartbeat rhythm information varies depending on the patient condition. It may not reveal valid information for synchronization all the time. 3. A BodyMAC protocol is a TDMA-based protocol where the channel is bounded by TDMA superframe structures with downlink and uplink subframes as given in Fig. 4. The downlink frame is used to accommodate the on-demand traffic and the uplink frame is used to accom- modate the normal traffic. There is no proper mechanism to handle emergency traffic. The uplink frame is further divided into CAP and CFP periods. The CAP period is used to transmit small size MAC packets. The CFP period is used to transmit the normal data in a TDMA slot. The duration of the downlink and uplink superframes are defined by the coordinator.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to estimate the incidence of Parkinson‚Äôs disease by age, gender, and ethnicity. Newly diagnosed Parkinson‚Äôs disease cases in 1994‚Äì1995 were identified among members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California, a large health maintenance organization. Each case met modified standardized criteria/Hughes diagnostic criteria as applied by a movement disorder specialist. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated using the Kaiser Permanente membership information as the denominator and adjusted for age and/or gender using the direct method of standardization. A total of 588 newly diagnosed (incident) cases of Parkinson‚Äôs disease were identified, which gave an overall annualized age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of 13.4 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4, 15.5). The incidence rapidly increased over the age of 60 years, with only 4% of the cases being under the age of 50 years. The rate for men (19.0 per 100,000, 95% CI: 16.1, 21.8) was 91% higher than that for women (9.9 per 100,000, 95% CI: 7.6, 12.2). The age- and gender-adjusted rate per 100,000 was highest among Hispanics (16.6, 95% CI: 12.0, 21.3), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (13.6, 95% CI: 11.5, 15.7), Asians (11.3, 95% CI: 7.2, 15.3), and Blacks (10.2, 95% CI: 6.4, 14.0). These data suggest that the incidence of Parkinson‚Äôs disease varies by race/ethnicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: To investigate the effects of increased syntactic complexity and utterance length demands on speech production and comprehension in individuals with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) using behavioral and physiological measures. Method: Speech response latency, interarticulatory coordinative consistency, accuracy of speech production, and response latency and accuracy on a receptive language task were analyzed in 16 individuals with PD and 16 matched control participants. ] Results: Individuals with PD had higher oral motor coordination variability, took a longer time to initiate speech, and made more errors on the speaking task compared with the control group. They also received lower scores on the 2 complex conditions of the receptive language task. Increased length and syntactic complexity negatively affected performance in both groups of speakers. Conclusions: These findings provide a novel window into the speech deficits associated with PD by examining performance on onger, sentence-level utterances in contrast to earlier investigations of single-word or nonword productions. Speech motor control processes and language comprehension were adversely affected in the majority of our participants with mild to moderate PD compared to the control group. Finally, increased syntactic complexity and sentence length affected both the healthy aging and PD groups‚Äô speech production performance at the behavioral and kinematic levels.},

  Review                   = {GRANDE PERGUNTA PARA A PESQUISA: Se um jogo s√©rio para aprendizagem necessita de pedagogia para o conhecimento cognitivo, um jogo s√©rio para sa√∫de necessita de q ??? Que teorias de fisioterapia para acompanhamento da sa√∫de, reabilita√ß√£o ou at√© mesmo acompanhamento, poderiam ser utilizadas para o desenvolvimento do jogo baseado nessas teorias. ============================= Mas a partir do momento que se rompeu este paradigma e passou-se a uma realidade marcada pela competitividade, onde as tarefas mais relevantes dentro de um sistema s√£o atribu√≠das √†quelas realizadas intelectualmente, ent√£o a fun√ß√£o de preparar os indiv√≠duos para conviver e modificar esta sociedade recai sobre a educa√ß√£o escolar. E a esta nova cultura de aprendizagem ampliada no ambiente tecnol√≥gico, reproduzindo ambientes da pr√≥pria sociedade, proporciona um grande leque de op√ß√µes e inova√ß√µes, e culmina na ruptura dos paradigmas convencionais de ensino [Valente, 1999]. Por√©m, existe grande resist√™ncia na incorpora√ß√£o de mudan√ßas no √¢mbito educacional, segundo Moran [2005] a escola √© uma institui√ß√£o mais tradicional que inovadora, e assim sendo mudar a cultura escolar √© uma tarefa mais √°rdua que mudar a cultura de uma sociedade. PROINFO - Programa Nacional de Tecnologia Educacional) e de inclus√£o digital (e.g. Programa computador para todos). Estes programas focam na infra-estrutura e aquisi√ß√£o de equipamentos computacionais, enquanto √© colocado em segundo plano a disponibiliza√ß√£o de software adequado para as mais diversas atividades do √¢mbito educacional e o treinamento dos recursos humanos envolvidos no processo de ensino-aprendizagem. E √© neste contexto que o presente trabalho foca, propondo desenvolver um software multim√≠dia, especificamente um serious game com enfoque educacional para uso no √¢mbito escolar, fazendo uso de pr√°ticas modernas de desenvolvimento de software (e.g. desenvolvimento centrado nos usu√°rios). Desde ent√£o, tais jogos v√™m evoluindo e ganhando espa√ßo em muitas √°reas do conhecimento com o prop√≥sito de auxiliar, treinar e informar ao mesmo tempo em que busca entreter, de tal forma que muitos pesquisadores definem o dom√≠nio na qual se inserem como ‚Äúedutainment‚Äù, uma aglutina√ß√£o das palavras educational e entertainment [Rapeepisam et al., 2006]. Ainda que existam controv√©rsias sobre seus benef√≠cios para fins educacionais os serious games v√™m sendo utilizados com mais freq√º√™ncia para esse fim, por possu√≠rem prop√≥sito educacional expl√≠cito ao promover a vincula√ß√£o entre o l√∫dico e o car√°ter afetivo dos usu√°rios com os ambientes de aprendizagem Mas, de acordo com Wang [2005], existem tr√™s pilares fundamentais para o sucesso na utiliza√ß√£o dos jogos no √¢mbito escolar, e que sem esses a experi√™ncia educacional com o uso de jogos dificilmente podem gerar resultados satisfat√≥rios. - Primeiro pilar: Exige educadores preparados, j√° que os alunos est√£o prontos para o ensino por meio de elementos de multim√≠dia, mas os professores, em geral, n√£o [Moran, 2005]; - Segundo pilar: Requer uma estrutura escolar e planejamento adequados, j√° que os professores sabem que precisam mudar, mas n√£o sabem bem como faz√™-lo e n√£o est√£o preparados para experimentar com seguran√ßa. E em muitos casos √© exigido destes tais mudan√ßas sem dar-lhes as condi√ß√µes necess√°rias para que eles as efetuem [Moran, 2005]; - Terceiro pilar: Se refere √† variedade e qualidade de jogos √† disposi√ß√£o que possibilitem escolhas adequadas. Ao fazer este paralelo, deve-se levar em conta que os aprendizes assistem ao v√≠deo uma √∫nica vez, e toda a sua informa√ß√£o √© transmitida em apenas uma sess√£o, enquanto o jogo entrega uma quantidade limitada de informa√ß√µes e oferece ao jogador a op√ß√£o de repetir cada sess√£o in√∫meras vezes, tendo em vista que os jogadores raramente ir√£o jogar um videogame de sucesso apenas uma vez, sendo esta caracter√≠stica que o diferencia de outros meios de comunica√ß√£o [Lieberman, 2001]. Stenberg [2000] foca do modo como as pessoas percebem, aprendem, recordam e pensam sobre a informa√ß√£o: - Teoria Construtivista - Teoria S√≥cio-Cultural - Teoria da Inclus√ß√£o - Aprendizagem baseada em problemas E, apesar de se fazerem importantes, a an√°lise do processo de cogni√ß√£o dos indiv√≠duos e das abordagens pedag√≥gicas mais adequadas, estas s√£o per si insuficientes para garantir a aceita√ß√£o do produto final de software, pois este envolve muitos fatores independentes (e.g. usabilidade, ergonomia) O autor baseasdo nas t√©cnicas de engenharia de software e de game design, prop√µe a execu√ß√£o de um processo de desenvolvimento que comece com a elicita~~ao do que deve ser aprendido, ponha em pr√°tica as regras de game design e fa√ßa a avalia√ß√£o ergonom√©trica do jogo na fase final. Estudo de Caso: O jogo ‚Äúsalve a cidade‚Äù, d√° enfoque sobre os principais problemas ambientais que assolam a sociedade atual. O usu√°rio se projeta no jogo, para realizar tarefas que ir√£o solucionar problemas espec√≠ficos nos mais variados cen√°rios (aprendizagem baseada em problemas), o autor levou em considera√ß√£o a teoria de vigotsky para desenvolver o jogo a partir da faixa et√°ria. Interface de Jogo: A interface foi elaborada de acordo com a divis√£o que alguns autores como Bethke [2003], Clua e Bittencourt [2005] fazem em jogos: (i) interface out-game e (ii) in-game. A interface out-game √© referente aos menus presentes fora do jogo, como o menu inicial, novo jogo e op√ß√µes, j√° a interface in-game √© aquela que exibe informa√ß√µes sobre o usu√°rio em tempo de jogo como invent√°rio e miss√µes, tanto em andamento, como as conclu√≠das. A apar√™ncia da aplica√ß√£o foi elaborada levando-se em conta o uso de met√°foras em interfaces [L√©vy, 2000; Braga, 2004] para tornar o jogo o mais intuitivo poss√≠vel.},

  Abstract                 = {Today, ubiquitous devices lack many of the security features known in desktop computing, an industry that is known to have a plethora of security problems. As ubiquitous devices are increasingly applied in the health care industry, security aspects need to receive even more attention. Clearly, patient-related data is extremely sensitive and legal requirements (such as HIPAA) attempt to enforce strict privacy controls. While we cannot solve the overall problem, our proposal to use RFID tags to authenticate users with ubiquitous devices addresses one of the most fundamental requirements of all security mechanisms: to reliably establish the user‚Äôs identity. In this paper we discuss some questions that raised during experiments with ubiquitous devices at Graz University Hospital. The main problems which could be identified included security and privacy issues (protection precautions, confidentiality, reliability, sociability). The experiments showed that new and emerging computer technologies such as mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing have an enormous potential for the improvement of manifold workflows in health care, however, psychological and technological research must be carried out together in order to bring clear benefits for the end-users and to optimize workflows in health care in the daily routine.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a software program (iGAIT) developed in MATLAB, for the analysis of gait patterns extracted from accelerometer recordings. iGAIT provides a user-friendly graphical interface to display and analyse gait acceleration data recorded by an accelerometer attached to the lower back of subjects. The core function of iGAIT is gait feature extraction, which can be used to derive 31 features from acceleration data, including 6 spatio-temporal features, 7 regularity and symmetry features, and 18 spectral features. Features extracted are summarised and displayed on screen, as well as an option to be stored in text files for further review or analysis if required. Another unique feature of iGAIT is that it provides interactive functionality allowing users to manually adjust the analysis process according to their requirements. The system has been tested under Window XP, Vista and Window 7 using three different types of accelerometer data. It is designed for analysis of accelerometer data recorded with sample frequencies ranging from 5&#xa0;Hz to 200&#xa0;Hz. },

  Review                   = {A Wearable computing consiste num sistema de computa√ß√£o m√≥vel com as seguintes caracter√≠sticas: em constante opera√ß√£o A computa√ß√£o vestida (WearComp) n√£o possui uma defini√ß√£o ainda, segundo o Prof Mann \cite{rohtua} da Universidade de Toronto esses sistemas possuem as seguintes caracter√≠sticas: est√£o presentes ou vestidas ao corpo humano e est√£o em constante opera√ß√£o monitorando a fisiologia do paciente atrav√©s de sensores. A computa√ß√£o vestida com a computa√ß√£o ub√≠qua torna poss√≠vel uma avali√ß√£o cl√≠nica do paciente sem precedentes, provendo um servi√ßo m√©dico personalizado em qualquer momento e a qualquer lugar. Metodologia ------------------- √â apresentado um modelo conceitual de 5 camadas (plataforma de hardware, sistema operacional, conex√£o de rede, middleware e aplica√ß√£o). 1. Plataforma de Hardware A plataforma de hardware √© respons√°vel por coletar os par√¢metros vitais do paciente, que consiste de um sensor m√©dico e um atuador, MCU, al√©m de uma unidade de armazenamento e um dispositivo de sa√≠da. Para satisfazer a portabilidade e os requisitos de conforto, os sensores e atuadores precisam ser miniaturizados e consumirem pouca energia. Atualmente os dados coletados s√£o: press√£o sangu√≠nea, pulso card√≠aco, a√ßucar, eletrocardiograma (ecg), temperatura corporal, peso, cintura, satura√ß√£o de oxig√™nio e eletroencefalograma (EEG). Os dispositivos de sa√≠da geralmente s√£o m√≥dulos de comunica√ß√£o wireless ou a fio. 2. Sistema Operacional O processamento dos dados em tempo-real requer um sistema operacional para a computa√ß√£o vestida reuer efici√™ncia e leveza. Desenvolver um sistema operacional para essa plataforma tem sido levado em considera√ß√£o, apesar de alguns sistemas fazerem uso do Windows CE ou varia√ß√µes do linux. Pesquisadores da UC Berkley exploram um novo sistema operacional especialmente desenvolvido para a Wearcomp denominado TinyOS. Esse sistema leva vantagem em algumas tecnologias existentes como: infraestrutura de software para execu√ß√£o de threads, mensagens ativas, direcionada a eventos e programa√ß√£o orientada a componentes. 3. Comunica√ß√£o de Rede A troca de dados deve ser realizada atrav√©s da conex√£o de rede. Do ponto de vista de execu√ß√£o a computa√ß√£o vestida se adequa mais as redes wirelesse e dispositivos como Bluetooth, Zigbee/IEEE 802.15.4 e conectores UWB. Al√©m de conex√£o GPRS com internet para transmitir os dados remotamente para os m√©dicos. 4.Middleware A principal fun√ß√£o de um middleware √© fazer quem que os componentes e sensores colaborem entre si. A estrutura de um middleware para a computa√ß√£o ub√≠qua vestida permite gerenciar provendo uma insfraestrutura de comunica√ß√£o atrav√©s de software. O objetivo principal do middleware para computa√ß√£o vestida √© prover que os sensores possam enviar seus dados para a unidade de armazenada para serem avaliados em um outro momento. 5. Aplica√ß√£o Os sistemas de computa√ß√£o vestida s√£o din√¢micos e permite que o m√©dico monitore e diagnostique o paciente atrav√©s da rede. Pode ser aplicado em diversos contextos. Medical sensors in wireless personal area network(WPAN) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Os sensores medicos WPAN atualmente est√£o usando os padr√µes Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), UWB(IEEE 802.15.3) e Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4). Transmiss√£o de dados do Pocket PC. Consiste de um gerenciador de informa√ß√µes pessoais, coletando os dados e comunicando. - Os dados colecionados e a comunica√ß√£o √© realizada atrav√©s de senroes m√©dicos WPAN. - O gerenciamento de arquivos realiza o armazenamento localmente evitando que os dados sejam perdidos quando a comunica√ß√£o falha. - Sistema de gerenciamento da sa√∫de que permite feedback, prescri√ß√£o m√©dica, recomenda√ß√£o de dieta, conselhos de exerc√≠cio atrav√©s de SMS. Esse sistema √© √∫til na troca remota de infroma√ß√µes no processo de diagn√≥stico e consulta. - Sistema de suporte que permite que a informa√ß√£o esteja dispon√≠vel durante o diagn√≥stico. Centro de Servi√ßo de Monitoramento --------------------------------------------------------- O centro de monitoramento deve ser respons√°vel em convergir o armazenamento com o processamento dos dados e isso √© realizado atrav√©s dos seguintes servi√ßos: - Registros eletr√¥nico de sa√∫de: que prov√™ todo o hist√≥rico cl√≠nico do paciente. - Sistema de supporte a decis√£o m√©dica (SSDM) que auxilia no diagn√≥stico - Sistema de suporte m√©dico que pode atrav√©s da an√°lise dos dados armazenados (tratamento medica√ß√£o). √â necess√°rio apoio suplementar nas evid√™ncias m√©dicas no sistema de informa√ß√µes cl√≠nicas. - Sistema de Feedback - Body Area Network ----------------------------- Uma BAN √© uma rede composta dos diferentes tipos de componentes computacionais distribu√≠dos no corpo. O Ban √© um sistema vestido usado para obetr, analisar e processar os sinais vitais, que s√£o cruciais para sistemas de sa√∫de m√≥veis. Vestido ou implantado os sensores s√£o conectados via rede e fazem a troca dos dados atrav√©s da BAN. Buscando satisfazer a limita√ß√£o dos recursos, A ban faz uso dos protocolos de rede.},

The ANN chosen to classify the gait data between normal and pathological is the type called self-organizing map (SOM) or Kohonen map, a type of ANN algorithm whose aim is to discover and display the underlying structure of the data entered in it, usually of high dimensionality.
SOM map operates as an appropriate classificatory taking into account that was able to recognize respectively, 72.09% (corresponding to 31 of 43 normal cases) and 70.21% (in this case, 33 of 47 parkinsonian cases) of normal and pathological gait patterns. Other evaluators of SOM performance},

abstract = {Abstract A new paradigm for medical care is emerging which terms itself ‚Äúpersonalized medicine‚Äù. Advocates claim that medical treatment can now be targeted on the specific characteristics of each individual, using genetic profiling to identify the particular nature of the condition, and to tailor treatments for each person. Further, they argue, the focus of medicine will move from treatment to prevention. It is claimed that genetic tests based on recent genomic research will enable doctors to identify susceptibilities for such common conditions before the onset of illness, and to target preventive intervention to reduce the individual and social burdens of ill health. Further, it is argued that genetic information will allow precision in the choice of drugs and doses, avoiding adverse reactions, minimising waste, reducing costs and increasing efficacy. Coupled with other advances, it is argued that the future of medicine should and will be ‚Äúpersonalised, predictive and preventive.‚Äù Drawing on such developments, we have seen the growth of personal genomics companies marketing tests ‚Äúdirect to consumers‚Äù that claim to identify individual disease susceptibilities and to ‚Äúempower‚Äù individuals by giving them the information‚Äîand the personal responsibility‚Äîto manage their own health. This paper critically assesses the promises made for personalized medicine, discusses some of the challenges for health policy, and considers the social and ethical implications of moving medical care towards such a personalized and individualized model. }
